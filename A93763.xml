            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here were ſome parts of this Book publiſhed the laſt year, but paſsing from the Author in much imperfection and ſome baſte, it is reviſed and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented according to the Progreſſe and Occurrences of the War: Many of the Paſſages therein are his own Collections obſerved at ſingle hand, the reſt produced through the Arguing and Diſcourſe betwixt ſome oppoſite in opinion to him, and himſelf a lover of Learning, although of ordinary and too mean parts to Diſcourſe it as an able Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; for he cannot but acknowledge that the ſubject of this Treatiſe might have been managed by a more learned and elaborate hand: The greater part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was begun about a twelvemoneth ſince in the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and divided times, by way of an Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary of the War, of the Occaſions and Accidents thereof, and had been printed a good while ſince, had not an unexpected chance croſſed in the very inſtant of putting it to the Preſſe. Now if in theſe more quiet and compoſed times, the Beams of Peace ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhine out again, it ſhould give offence, or in
<pb facs="tcp:113760:3"/> the leaſt way interrupt the happy and hoped for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement, which it doth not in the Authors ſence, and to his best underſtanding, his heart is against the publiſhing, the Diſcourſe relating rather to what is past, and may ſerve for future times. It is probable that in theſe times of Conflict, this Diſcourſe, as milde and plain as it is, may meet with rough harſh anſwers and unkinde cenſurings, as that the Author is an <hi>Ambidexter,</hi> Neutral, that he cunningly carries himſelf betwixt both parts, ſometimes and in ſome things for the King, at other times and in other things for the Parliament: Whereunto he replyes, and ingenuouſly declares himſelf both for whom and against whom he is, For whom? For the King and Parliament: Against whom? Against the Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the happy Peace, having long ſince been the authors, and now the promoters conſequently of this horrid War: and that there are and have been ſuch, a woful and ſad Experience doth manifeſt.</p>
            <p>A favorable and upright interpretation is all the Reward the Author either looks or wiſhes for, next unto, That His Majestie and His Subjects may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally enjoy and hold firmly and entirely their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Rights.</p>

            <p>The manner of being called is by <note n="*" place="margin">See the form of the Writ in the Crown Office.</note> Writ, directed to the high Sheriff of every County, as to the chief Magiſtrate of Burrough Towns, to return Knights and Burgeſſes for that ſervice, ſo Habited, <hi>viz.</hi> with ſwords girt on their ſides, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Which habit, a Note and Embleme of the valour in them, required the Object to do and go on with Courage and Magnanimity in diſcharging their truſt, which their Country hath repo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113760:4"/> which controules, and is to give Laws to Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The end of their Aſſembling, is to determine, Ordain, and provide for the peace, Juſtice, and ſafety (the ſupreameſt Law) of the Kingdom; called thereunto by his Majeſty, Entruſted by their Country: Whoſe Councels and Ordinances become Laws, Or in caſe of variance in Judgement, that ſo many as are there met cannot all agree in the ſame opinion, that paſſeth for a Law which the major part concludes on; ſo it fares in every body Politique and Aggregative: And thoſe the Parliament Orders and Ordinances are binding to the Subject, as Orders in Inferiour Courts of Chancery, Common Pleas, &amp;c. untill decrees and Judgements paſſe to confirm the ſame, which decrees and Judgements in thoſe lower Courts hold Analogy with Acts and Laws in the higher Court of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The work and end of the Parliament being conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, the Laws enacted, the Parliament then determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the King governes onely and ſupreame, binding himſelf to obſerve thoſe Laws by a double Oath, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely,</hi> as being a King, and ſo bound to Rule and govern according to the Laws; Expreſly, by his Oath taken at his Coronation.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak in a plain grammatical and obvious way, the Latine <hi>Etimon</hi> directs the duty of a King: <hi>Rex,</hi> is ſo called <hi>à Regendo:</hi> Government is diſpenced in wiſdom and juſtice, <note n="*" place="margin">From which text the Kings Party do contend, that Kings are immediatly from God: no more then as follows in the ſubſequent verſe, Nobles do Rule, and judges of, &amp;c.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Schiſm</hi> oppoſite in themſelves, agree in this, that they both do undermine and ſeek the rooting out of the <hi>true Proteſtant Religion; This,</hi> participatively, and by ſecret wiles; <hi>That,</hi> privatively, and by open Enmity; the one may be an aberration from, the other is <hi>Idolatry</hi> and oppoſition to the true <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi>

            <p>If in this Contention the Kings Army ſhall prevail, many Papiſts engaged and Commanders in it, what is like to be the ſequel? Thoſe Papiſts and their followers will hope and challenge it as a condign Reward, to have an eſpecial intereſt in His favour, becauſe they ſay it was

            <p>And if in this Quarrel Popery ſhall be let in, when Juſtice and Law ſhall fail, when every one given up to his own heart's Luſt, the Papiſts and other the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Enemies will in an exprobratory way, thank the Parliament as the cauſe thereof.</p>
            <p>It is true, it may be ſaid ſo accidentally and very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely, but neither the Impulſive, Formal, or Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe, rather (if Logick will bear ſuch a member in the diviſion of cauſes) a deficient cauſe, as the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or rather the Ecclipſe of the Sun, the cauſe of Darkneſſe, their endeavours having failed of ſucceſſe, being interrupted by a ſtrong and countermanding Power oppoſing them.

            <p> The Authors and Fautours of thoſe <note place="margin">Before this time of War there were no ſuch Schiſms or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies: <hi>Tautum res nobis</hi> (ſaith learned <hi>Iewel) cum quibuſdam ſatellitibus Pontificiis, &amp;c.</hi> and it is requiſite that Vnity and Peace be ſetled in the <hi>Church</hi> as well as in the <hi>State,</hi> for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of theſe Schiſms and Hereſies; God delighting, yea and requiring it, to have Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Truth in his preſence chamber [the <hi>Church]</hi> as in his larger courts [the <hi>Common-wealth].</hi> The Authors of the War have been the Authors of theſe Hereſies: [which ſide?]</note> 
               <hi>Schiſms</hi> being few and inconſiderable, their Tenents newly ſprung up, and apt to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh both through the inſufficiency of their <hi>grounds,</hi> and multiformity of their Sects, wounding and weakning one another, and in the main, the Common cauſe: For it is the firm and Orthodox Proteſtants, which are the Parliaments firm friends whereon to truſt, yea and their conſtant friends alſo, whilſt the Parliament goes on, in an entire, ſolid, and joynt way, and are as the Exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their Affairs ſhall ſuffer them, conſtant to themſelves, whereby, and by which way alone, they are inabled to defend themſelves, to protect their Friends.</p>
            <p>Which ſide will prevail, God only knows, who can diſpoſe of Victories at his will: If the Parliament ſhall, the King nevertheleſſe could not but aſſure Himſelf, that He ſhould be entirely <hi>King;</hi> howſoever part of His Eſtate be by reaſon of theſe Wars diminiſhed, and the Parliaments Proteſtation taken 1641. together with their late Covenant two years after, for the <hi>maintenance of His juſt Power and greatneſſe,</hi> were good ſecurity, until themſelves were reputed <hi>Traitors, Rebels,</hi> their <hi>worth</hi> in like maner undervalued, and ſcorned by His party; for ſo the Proteſtation and Covenant both may loſe their efficacy and intent, if He for whom they do Proteſt and Vow, ſhall by oppoſing, diſable them in the proſecution of their Vow.</p>
            <p>To that Objection, <hi>That the Parliament have contrary to ſuch Covenant, Uſurped and Intrenched upon His Regal Dignity, and by ſeeking to hinder His Power, have leſſened</hi>

               <hi>His Honor, in paſsing an Ordinance againſt His Majeſties cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of Lords, &amp;c. in ſeeking to have their Friends Inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Honors and Titles anſwerable to their demerits.</hi> To the firſt it is confeſt, an Ordinance is paſt againſt all ſuch Acts as may inure by vertue of the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons being made by Patent under the ſame Seal, which being a neceſſary Inſtrument of State, which the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament repreſents, being ſurreptitiouſly taken from them contrary to a Truſt; they have conſequently paſſed an Ordinance againſt the Creating of Lords, <hi>ut Supra:</hi> For the Contention betwixt Him and them being grown ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, the King ſtriving by all means to leſſen their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Credit, uſing all ways to advance His own [their Enemies;] they knowing likewiſe the Seal to be made uſe of to their Detriment, as <hi>if that the Kings conferring thoſe Honors, were not ſo much an augmentation of His Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in granting, or in the created Lords, in receiving thoſe Honors, as an intended diminution to the Parliaments Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> had reaſon to provide for the time againſt all contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Acts, tending to the leſſening their Power. Admit it to be as the Objectors give out, which neither the Kings party do prove, nor the Parliaments do grant, as in other Acts done by the Parliament, <hi>An Uſurping in them;</hi> Uſurpation may in the ſtrength of policy prove a benefit to the Subject, in that Uſurpers do commonly Eſtabliſh the beſt Laws to redeem their Credit, loſt by the Injury done in their Uſurping.</p>
            <p>If the Kings party ſhall prevail, the War being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Him and His People, the Parliament rather an Umpire in the Quarrel, to do right to the wronged part, there will be two things conſiderable; The means whereby He doth prevail; The end of His prevailing.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113760:10"/> The firſt means, not primarily as in the ſtrength or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of His party, yet conſequently in that His party do undividedly retain and keep up the Ancient and ſetled Form of Government, without conteſting or diſſenting in opinion about the Eſtabliſhing any new: As on the other ſide, the Parliament hath thrown down the old, without (for a long time) ſetting up any other Form or Conſtitution; It was a learned Fathers Obſervation, <note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> 
               <hi>Ipſa mutatio quae utilitate adjuvat etiam novitate perturbat:</hi> And it will require a moſt exact deliberate Wiſdom to ſuppreſſe all Inconveniences which may ariſe on Novity: Hence it hath been, that the Parliaments Friends have grown leſſe zealous to their ſide, more troubleſom to the Court it ſelf, by requiring and ſeeking a new and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Form.</p>
            <p>Which may admit a twofold Anſwer, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament interrupted by a powerful Enemy, hath not a full meaſure of Efficacy to conform and compoſe every collateral difference, happing either in Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; when as their Task is hard enough to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and keep a work more neceſſary, <hi>[Their own Power.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, In that they have for a time aboliſhed thoſe ancient Forms, and conſtitutions, finding haply ſome preſent reaſon for ſo doing: whether they will forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with eſtabliſh ſome other Forme, as it is probable they will, having long ſince promiſed it, or reaſſume the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, when time ſhall ſerve? (there being no ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial difference betwixt what is now abrogated, and what is to be Ordained) is left to their wiſdom; beſides, it is preſumed in point of Judgement and of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, that they will have ſuch reſpect unto their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors Acts, as not altogether to raze out, to abrogate
<pb facs="tcp:113760:10"/> for ever their ancient Conſtitutions, leaſt ſucceeding Parliaments ſhould do the like by theirs, and ſo the Courts of Parliament, which have been inſtituted for <hi>redreſſe of Miſchiefs and Grievances, &amp;c.</hi> ſhould become <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See Statute Edw.</hi> 3.</note> the <hi>Scene</hi> and <hi>Seminary</hi> of inconvenience and diſturbance; by introducing ſtill Novelties, and alterations in the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>The third is, in that His Majeſty keeping His reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a leſſe Town of Gariſon <hi>[Oxford]</hi> can more eaſily conform and ſubdue a few unto His will, then the Parliament can in a more greater place <hi>[London<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>]</hi> The multitude in that City, the ſupplies and Ayd, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the City to the Parliament, can counterpoiſe ſuch odds.</p>
            <p>The event of His Majeſties prevailing is alike conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable and two-fold alſo: firſt, in that the Parliament Members, already proſcribed and charged with <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> are expoſed to <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>ruine,</hi> in them a great part of the Subjects of both Kingdoms, when as the cauſe, wherein the Publique good is ſo much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is by idle and <hi>abject</hi> Fellows called already in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion <hi>[The Cauſe.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, In that a forraign Enemy upon a total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation of this Realm (without which the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not probably prevail) will be induced to believe, and accordingly make uſe of it, that it hath happened, through the ſoft and tender breeding of the Engliſh, their unfitneſſe to endure the hardſhip of a War, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade and by degrees implant this Kingdom; And what a Forraigner implanted here, his Demeanour may prove towards our King, not naturally their liege Lord, every good Engliſh Subject will fear the worſt: <hi>when as</hi>

            </p>
            <p>To ſtate the differences of Forces on either part, when the quarrel firſt began, the Parliament had far the greater <note n="*" place="margin">The number of the Friends and Adverſaries unto either part are calculated, and their ſeveral Forts diſcerned about the middle of this Book, and which part was in probability like to finde the greater oppoſition, the King or the Parliament as matters were then in being, in which it will appear that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had the more Enemies, or their Enemies the more Friends.</note> number, the King having but few yet more then the Parliament had Towns of Fort (as his party have Calculated and hyperbolically reported otherwiſe) moſt mens hearts being bent to defend their <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> which they thought were of late encroached upon, and indeed the Off-ſpring of this Quarrel, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Friends believing the Juſtice of that Court, and of their Cauſe, in a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe way of affording Ayd, threw all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the chance of War, without uſing the ordinary means concurrent to their defence, not foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what would be the end and miſchief of their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and neglect to be repented of, not remedied.</p>
            <p>They were willing enough to have redreſſe for their late-paſt grievances, to have the work done, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſpeed well at their Neighbours charge, ſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be ſaved harmleſſe, but to lay out money and purchaſe the name of a <hi>Rebel,</hi> in caſe the Kings party ſhould prevail, was both a chargeable and double Crime.</p>
            <p>Then their unwillingneſſe to be expoſed to the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of a War, to which they were altogether unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, believing in the goodneſſe and ſufficiency of

            <p>For now every ſhort enjoyment of their quiet, every ſmall reſpite from the Enemies cruelty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the next bordering Counties unto them be infeſted round about with their cruelty, makes theſe men apprehend that the War is ended, becauſe their Coaſt is for the preſent clear, and they feel no inſtant ſmart.</p>
            <p>It is true, Gods Providence is in all things to be obſerved; it is as his Omnipotency, <hi>Infinite,</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent</hi> to every Creature, <hi>No one hair falls from a mans head, nor a Sparrow from the houſe top without his Providence.</hi> The ſame Almighty power which could <hi>reſcue his three Servants out of the fiery Furnace, and provide ſtrength of the mouthes of Infant Babes,</hi> is able, but whether he will or not (his works being unſearchable, and his ways paſt finding out) give ſucceſſe according to the peoples wiſhing, without the ordinary means to be uſed by Inſtruments, that is left to his ſecret and determinate Councel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is a time for War, and a time for Peace; the Lord is a man of War, his Name is JEHOVAH;</hi> and Fighting in a qualified ſence, as Praying, is a duty. <hi>DAVID bleſſed God for teaching his hands to War, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Prayer</hi> is a Chriſtians, a contrite and good mans Arms. Had we in Unity and Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of Spirit, in the <hi>Power,</hi> without the <hi>Form</hi> of Godlineſſe, beſought Almighty God to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113760:12"/> from <hi>Famine, Battel, Murder,</hi> and from <hi>Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death,</hi> as the Church directs; Theſe Calamities had not in likelihood come nigh, which threaten now to come upon us <hi>like an Armed man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſeeching God by Prayer might peradventure be the Peoples ſacrifice alone, neglecting otherwiſe their own endeavors, and careleſly truſting (if at all) upon God; his Providence they think ſufficient, which is confeſt: In which they may alike conſider, That if the Kings party ſhall prevail, or the whole Land be conſumed and reduced even to a handful; It is all within the compaſſe of Gods power; <hi>The Lot is caſt, but the diſpoſing is of the Lord;</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that ſide which uſeth the beſt and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current means to his diſpoſe (the Juſtice of the Cauſe is challenged by either party) is likely to have the upper hand.</p>
            <p>Praying and relying on the Almighty goodneſs, ſeldom fails the Petitioner, God ever giving what <hi>he prayeth for, what ſuffices, or what is better then he asks;</hi> but the means muſt be added to the prayer, <hi>Qui ordinat finem ordinat etiam media tendentia ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem. Moſes</hi> at the coming of the <hi>Amalakites,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord by prayer, yet commanded <hi>Joſhua</hi> to chooſe out men to fight with <hi>Amalck.</hi> God is in all things the firſt Mover, by whom we move and have our being; he the Super-eminent and firſt cauſe, yet working by ſubſervient and ſecond means; we are his People, and Members of his <hi>Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant,</hi> againſt which the Gates of Hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. In the Creation his own glory was the effect of his chief care, manifeſted unto us his Creatures;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113760:12"/> his next affording us all neceſſaries for our ſupport and good; he looks to be ſought unto, and truſted upon in that courſe of obedience which he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, in conveying that unto us which we look for at his hands, otherwiſe he is rather ſlighted then truſted on.</p>
            <p>Had the people been ſo liberal in Contributing to to their own Defence; ſo provident to have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, that within one year after their improvidence they ſhould have been thus oppreſt; in the progreſs of one year more undone, they would queſtionleſſe have been more liberal, and concurred more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in Contributing to their own Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>For within a few Moneths after the War began, many in the Kingdom fell off from the Parliament, and under fear, and the notion of being reputed <hi>Rebels,</hi> thought it made againſt their preſent ſafety to wiſh well to the Parliament (a Court ſcarce known in the Countrey, and diſcontinued in the Kingdom) much more to fight for it: And hearing of divers invective Threats and Menaces to that purpoſe, as if their Endeavors for the Parliament did make againſt the King, and ſo reſemble a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> thought it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unſafe to adhere to the Parliament: So the Kings ſtrength increaſing through the fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of many formerly engaged to the other part, he gained divers Towns in ſeveral parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>On which his Friends and Party fix a Miracle, reckoning it an <hi>extraordinary Act of Gods Favor ſhewed to him in the ſudden increaſe of his Party, that from an handful as it were, he hath raiſed Forces to ſuch numbers,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:113760:13"/> when as the Miracle may be retorted, and rather turned the other way, That his Majeſty being ſo <hi>Pious, Juſt</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant</hi> a Prince (as his party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, and an <note n="*" place="margin">See the <hi>Oath</hi> tendred at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> 1643.</note> 
               <hi>Oath</hi> to that purpoſe hath been ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to divers of late within his Quarters) there ſhould be notwithſtanding ſuch a defection from him in his Subjects, ſo many thouſand alſo not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged nor ſeduced, men of ſufficiency and worth miſtaken in what is <hi>Loyalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is Victory in a <hi>Civil War</hi> any evident note of the Almighty's favor, when as it is obtained on ſuch hard terms, as the Ruine and Deſtruction of a flouriſhing Land; rather in the Event it will prove an angry Judgement of Gods puniſhing the Authors of this Ruine, in ſuffering <note n="*" place="margin">See the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of both Houſes, <hi>March</hi> 9. 1643.</note> above and beyond all others, a Civil War, conſuming and overthrowing the Body Politique, as a peſtilent Feaver doth the Natural with its diſtempered heat.</p>
            <p>As for the Towns the Kings party gained, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by His Commanders wit and Stratagem, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable in War) or by falſhood in point of parly and of truſt (odious and ſcorned even in Forrain Wars) is hereafter examinable, and to be tryed by the Sword alone; yet one word, what that falſhood is, when a Commander or Officer in chief, ſhall Swear by Solemn Oath and Vow, to perform what he never means, and after a truſt committed and an agreement made, break and falſifie the ſame.</p>
            <p>And whether it be Treachery and falſhood, or Stratagem and Policy, doth reſt upon this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>[Whether the Parliaments Proceedings be Rebellious, unbecoming Subjects,</hi> or <hi>juſt and Loyal.]</hi> If Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113760:13"/> then it may ſeem Stratagem and duty to the King, in ſuch Commanders entruſted by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to renounce their truſt and ſerve the Enemy. If the Parliament be good and faithful Subjects, as they will rather ſacrifice their lives to the Juſtice of their Cauſe, then fail to Vindicate their Credit from the ſtain of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> then it is Treachery in thoſe Commanders to undertake afterwards to deſert ſuch Truſt.</p>
            <p>That ſuch foul dealing hath been practiſed, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning the protraction of this War is manifeſt, on which ſide moſt, future Ages or the Sword will manifeſt.</p>
            <p>If it be anſwered by way of excuſe, as no crimes whatſoever ſhall want a patron in theſe divided times, That <hi>ſuch dealing is a vertue, practiſable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to a Kings Safety, in danger to be deſtroyed, and that breach of Faith, of Truſt, never ſo Solemnly made, or any other the like means may be uſed in Order to His preſervation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This Argument may be Fallacy, <hi>à petitione Principii,</hi> or <hi>à non conceſsis,</hi> which manner of diſputing can enlarge <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> and as the <hi>Logicians</hi> ſpeak, The reply thereto may be unto ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that there is no ſuch deteſtable, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate deſign in being, or known or granted.</p>
            <p>Where by the way, and to prevent the miſtake <note place="margin">☞</note> of our duty, and Allegiance which we ſhould owe to our Soveraign; if any exquiſite wits of a more nimble diſcerning reach then their fellow Subjects, pretending a greater care to His Majeſties welfare, have heretofore found out by privy and dark paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113760:14"/> by any ſecrecy of contrivance, any ſuch wicked and execrable intendments againſt the Kings Perſon or Honor, or deeming all others not partaking in their ſagacity, Ignorant in State affairs, dull and vulgar ſpirited; Let them make known unto their fellow Subjects, the time, the means, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of that intendment, before the whole Land be totally deſtroyed, or a full Conqueſt be obtained, for afterwards all writers will report one way, in favour of the Victors ſide; then alſo the victory, not the Cauſe, will point out, and ſet forth the Rebel.</p>
            <p>That two or three Gentlemen (ſince Members of the Houſe of Commons) together with a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Peer in the Houſe of Lords, dwelling in neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Counties each to other, and ſojourning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven or eight years ſince, with a Gentleman, a neighbour and friend of theirs; did, during the time of their ſojourning there, therefore agree to overthrow Monarchial Government, or intend any thing againſt the Honor or Perſon of the King: if neither of theſe appeared by their diſcourſe, Letters, or other Acts in writing, the Arguer ſhews more his ſpleen againſt thoſe Gentlemen, then his Reaſon in deducing any good Connexion between the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent and Concluſion.</p>
            <p>Obſerve on the other ſide, one among many other preſumptions of ſome Deſign in hand from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers party, then let the Reader judge on which ſide is the more weighty and vehement preſumption of Acting miſchief, of complotting alterations in matter of Government: which the more rational
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113760:14"/> Conſequence, that inſtance which went before, even now recited, or this which follows? namely, the building ſtrong and high walls by a great Peer of this Realm, to his houſe (no other notice taken until now, ſave of beautifying and adorning the houſe for his private uſe and ſplendour) the divers Pieces of Ammunition, credibly informed to be caried thither by little and little for theſe many years laſt paſt; and now one of the ſtrongeſt Holds the Kings party hath in all <hi>South-Wales,</hi> to infeſt and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Parliaments party.</p>
            <p>Whileſt the truth of ſuch Plot, of overthrowing Monarchial Government, of ſome miſchievous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment againſt the Kings Majeſty (if any ſuch there be ſuggeſted) is no more manifeſted to the World; it may be an Impoſture framed and obtruded on the Parliament by ſome offenders, who to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have contrived this Calumny and Falſhood, on purpoſe to engage the King to reſcue them.</p>
            <p>The Parliament, when this report was firſt given conſiſted of above Five hundred Members in both Houſes; And whether they having <hi>all Proteſted for the Kings Honor, Perſon and Eſtate,</hi> would againſt the dictate of their own Conſcience, againſt their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and ſworn Allegiance, infringe this <hi>Vow,</hi> to commit wilful Perjury and Treaſon.</p>
            <p>Or that if it be objected, That the Deſign was the drift only of ſome few (accuſed and ſtiled fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious perſons) ſolliciting and awing others; then to aſſign who thoſe few perſons were, and rather to blame the Counties and Corporations chuſing ſuch: Queſtionleſſe when firſt choſen, their chuſers ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113760:15"/> no ſuch Crime in them, and whether men known and choſen for their vertue would accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſuch Villanies as thoſe.</p>
            <p>Such a Deſign muſt be given out, at leaſt to ſave the credit of ſome revolting, who having undertaken the charge and care of their ſeveral Counties to them deputed, were at firſt active in their Muſterings and Military practiſes: Soon after, whether wrought by Friends, Allies, or for ſome other reſpect, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, charging the Parliament or ſome of them in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms, with ſome ſtrange intended Plot againſt the King, but without declaring what Plot, or the Authors, which had they particularly and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, and ſo ſufficiently proved the reaſon of their revolt, it might have ſpared the effuſion of much blood, and more availed the Kings Cauſe then their revolting did.</p>
            <p>They did not doubtleſſe originally and from the firſt diſſemble, as to ſit in a joynt and unanimous way with the Parliament, and reſerve their heart for an advers party to the Parliament; few or none of any ſorts of men were good at that cloſe and ſubtile po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; nor was diſſembling then in that mature growth, as theſe falſe and deſperate ſeaſons will bring in, even amongſt all ſorts, improving it to that obſtruſe and exquiſite form, as the vertue of wiſdom. And the ſubtilty of diſſembling growing to be near the ſame, moſt mens carriage will ſeem inconſtant, if not falſe. Upon deliberation and advice, thoſe men undertook their charge, and what wrought the change in them; ſuch mens inſtability is made much of, their perſons little.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:113760:15"/>
            <p> Now that the Parliament ſhould at this time have the upper hand, the Kings party loſing more in ſome places then they gain in other; and that he having gathered Forces theſe three years or more, and ſet forth Proclamations to ſubdue and awe thoſe whom he calls his Enemies, and not to over-match them: 'Tis probable, that howbeit Fear and Inconſtancy have brought many to his party, a mightier hand over-awing all, hath provided ſtrength and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to have his purpoſe brought to paſſe beyond the ordinary power of man, and by his mighty Hand, and out-ſtretched Arm, to make his own Glory the more manifeſt through the infirmity of weak men.</p>
            <p>As to the Proclamations ſet forth in the Kings Name, of ſmall advantage to his Cauſe; it is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether his or not, or publiſhed only in his Name, without his aſſent: The ordinary matter of a Proclamation, ariſeth on ſome emergent Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of State; binding for the preſent, anon altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of little or no uſe: Theſe kindes of Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Condemning,</hi> are ſurviving Acts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Subject Proclaimed againſt.</p>
            <p>Again, Proclamations have been heretofore ſet forth only as Arbitrary and Temporary Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Prince's pleaſure to grant Indulgence, to prevent or cure ſome Inconveniences in State-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſerving for a light and preſent remedy, until ſome judicial Act of Law ſhall apyly a more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and certain one.</p>
            <p>If they were to no other end, then that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Proclaimed againſt might by the terror of ſuch an Imperial Act, be brought into obedience, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113760:16"/> then to be received to mercy; yet they and moſt men elſe held it the ſafer courſe, being not guilty, to keep out of their Accuſers reach, and not to put it to Arbitriment, whether they ſhould be Condemned or Pardoned, when as alſo their perſonal ſufferings, in loſſe of life as <hi>Traytors,</hi> had not ſatisfied the thirſt of their Accuſers: It is the Enthralling, and as it were the Disfranchizing and Embaſing a free born Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to ſtand to the Expectance of mercy, when he knows his heart to be free from guilt.</p>
            <p>A Traytor in his Araignment is admitted to his lawful Tryal, demanded what he can ſay for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Proclamation ties <hi>him</hi> up from his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: Crimes of a lower rank are not conſtrued ſo [as Fellonies] unleſſe the minde concurreth with the Fact (for the * intent doth make the Fellony) Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <note place="margin">See the Form of <hi>Indictm Felonice.</hi>
               </note> a Crime of a deeper Dye, ſtaining the blood, ruining the Poſterity with the Eſtate, ought to be tryed in a more upright and ſober courſe, by Judges of an entire and impartial vertue: Contention and the Sword are no fit Umpires in the Queſtion of <hi>[Who be Traytors.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a harſh and ſevere proceeding, for a man to be be charged with Crimes by Proclamation, to which no Anſwer can be given, and to be debar'd from what he can reaſonably ſay for himſelf: It is as ſtrange, that ſeeing we are Subjects under the ſame King and Government, his Proclamations ſhould finde ſuch contrary entertainment, ſo weighty on the one ſide, as to <hi>proſcribe</hi> and <hi>awe,</hi> yet ſo ſlight unto the other, as not to be obeyed or credited.</p>
            <p>For Example ſake, the frequent Proclamations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113760:16"/> Papiſts reſorting to his Majeſties Court; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtraightly charging in his Majeſties Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as to this preſent War, <note n="*" place="margin">In anſwer to a Declaration of the Lords and Commons for the raiſing of all Power and Force, as well Trained-Bands as others, in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> 1642.</note> That no Papiſt ſhould preſume to Liſt himſelf ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as an Officer or a Soldier in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, having directed how he ſhould be diſcocovered, if he did preſume, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer if he were diſcovered.</p>
            <p>If neceſſity be pleaded, for the King to make uſe of them his Subjects for his own defence againſt thoſe whom he calls <hi>Rebels:</hi> Or if the like Plea be made in excuſe of thoſe his Majeſties Deſigns of late diſcovered, as that he hath been neceſſitated and driven by his Subjects to try all means whatſoever for his reducing them, for the reparation of his own Honor, which <hi>he complains they ſeek to trample on.</hi> The examining of the original of this War, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who the Authors of it have been, as alſo how this neceſſity, ſo called, hath hapned, and whether the King ſhould have had need to have made uſe of any of his Subjects for his own Defence, or to have expreſſed his diſpleaſure againſt other of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>For his own parties not obeying his Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Edicts, as is obſerved, Thoſe publiſhed in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> 1643. the one againſt Robbing, Spoiling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The other Pardoning all Members of Parliament, ſome few by name excepted; many of them ſo pardoned have had their Lands ſeized on by his Soldiers, their Houſes held from them by ſtrong hand: So the Proclamations ſlighted, the Laws proteſted to be kept, broken, the Subject and his <hi>Right</hi> trampled on.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:113760:17"/>
            <p> Many the like Edicts and Declarations of Favor and Liberty granted to his People (to ſome upon their humble * Petition preſented to his Majeſty; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">See the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers</hi> in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and his Majeſties An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. 1643.</note> others from a compaſſion and ſence in his Majeſty of their ſufferings) ſeem neither his own Acts, nor ſcarce ſeen by him, not <hi>able</hi> to make good what he commands, or not <hi>real,</hi> in not intending to make good what he had promiſed.</p>
            <p>The figurative Dialect, and ſtrong expreſſions wherein thoſe Declarations and Meſſages are pen'd, beſides the matter of them, are probably none of his, neither is it poſſible that any ones heart ſhould have ſo large a capacity; the King's not leaſure enough amongſt the oppoſitions of croſſe Councels, amidſt the variety of ſuch accidents as hourly happen, to examine, digeſt, command and declare all matters, ſubject and ſuitable to ſuch accidents, the demeanor of his party alſo quite contrary to his Declarations and Commands.</p>
            <p>The Proclamations in <hi>July</hi> the ſame year, <hi>forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Trade and Traffique unto his chiefest and Imperial City,</hi> ſhould not in likelihood be his own, to ſtarve up that place where ſome of his Royal Iſſue are: when as the detriment befalls not the City only, 'tis more extenſive to all parts of this Kingdom with which the City tradeth: For they being denied an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe, cannot vent their wares: So in caſe the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were guilty of what the Proclamation doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it, the Juſtice and proceeding is not adequate, where many ſuffer beſides the offendors.</p>
            <p>There be divers other Meſſages and Declarations printed in his Name, which were want of duty in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113760:17"/> his Subjects to think them his, or with his aſſent.</p>
            <p>As to thoſe ſubordinate Edicts ſet forth hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when his party had gained ſome Weſtern Towns, publiſhed under ſome of his chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders hands, and read in Pariſh Churches, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining his Soldiers from Robbing, Spoiling, and the like violence; and as in caſe of Felony, the Countrey to riſe and purſue them, according to the Law in that caſe provided, as Thieves and Murtherers:</hi> Such Meſſages and Edicts might carry a fair flouriſh of Juſtice, and be plauſible to the Subject; but when as he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed and diſabled every way, and hath no weapon to defend himſelf, what courage or ſtrength hath he to repulſe ſuch violence? A few armed Soldiers dare to Rob on the <hi>High ways,</hi> yea, and to venture into Towns, and do what they liſt without reſiſtance: How many have loſt their lives of late, ſtriving to reſcue and defend their goods?</p>
            <p>When Commanders ſhall promiſe to ſecure the Subject, he notwithſtanding robbed, when in the Kings Name, and under his Authority (as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is made believe) things ſhall be promiſed impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable in the act of promiſing, untrue in the Event, a Subjects duty may make him facile; but if his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of what he ſees, gives him not ſufficient light, but that he will ſubmit againſt his Reaſon, and thereby miſcarry in being over-credulous, he may thank himſelf.</p>
            <p>It is not ſpeculation, or matter of doubt or jealouſie which diſturbs and divides the thoughts of man, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome of one, ſome of another mind; or any mans affections to the one or the other ſide, which governs
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:113760:18"/> in the apprehenſion of matters, as now they are, it is matter of Fact; the eyes are more faithful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes then the ears, what hath been done, what hath been attempted, what hath been promiſed not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, which doth clear the doubt.</p>
            <p>To believe, is required from Subjects, to obey, their <hi>Duty;</hi> but when to believe and obey againſt Fact and Reaſon, on whom lies the fault, if they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in their obedience and belief? which is not therefore written to abſolve or releaſe a Subject from his immediate duty to his Prince, who is to be obeyed in all things <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>Honest,</hi> as before expreſt; but the <hi>Peſts</hi> and <hi>Vipers</hi> about him, as King * <hi>James</hi> termeth them, are to be oppugned as the <note place="margin">His Speech in Parliament, 1609.</note> exactors and commanders of that unlimited and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defined tribute of obedience.</p>

            <p>The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was angry with the Author who writing the Hiſtory of his Succeſſe againſt his Enemies, flatters, and attributes that to the King, which was myſtically ſpoken of <hi>Chriſt, Pſal.</hi> 45. <hi>Gird thee with thy Sword upon thy thigh, O thou moſt mighty, according to thy Honor and Renown.</hi> Such flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in his Subjects was diſpleaſing to his Majeſty.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, by a mutual and Solemn Covenant and Articles entred into of late, wherein both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſtand engaged.</p>
            <p>As for them our Brethren, whether invited to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Engliſh, their fellow Subjects, for which ſome of the <note n="*" place="margin">See the Articles of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon exhibited againſt the ſix Members of Parliament, <hi>Ian.</hi> 1641.</note> Engliſh were charged of Treaſon, as bringing over a Forraign Nation to invade their own; or whether the Scots willing of themſelves, as knowing what hath been attempted againſt their National Laws and Rights: Let the caſe be rightly ſtated, if to bring over a Forraigner to invade the Natives of theirs who bring them over, be an offence of ſo high a nature, the Kings party queſtionleſſe are the greater offendors, having labored, no ways left unaſſayed to bring Forces from beyond Sea, to oppoſe and fight againſt their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113760:20"/> under the Name of REBELS.</p>
            <p>What relation the Nations have each to other, is known, the one not Forraign or Stranger unto the other, unleſſe the malice of this War, and a party oppoſing both, ſhall make them ſtrangers, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them both within themſelves: Their mutual Aid and Concurrence, is the end of the mutual Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to repulſe a Forraigner from invading <hi>either;</hi> and then the one or both may be of uſe to return courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, when received (neither having been ever brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Ingratitude) or to reſent Affronts or Injuries when offered.</p>
            <p>There hath been long ſince much War, many bloody Battels fought between the two Nations, ſince which time an Union hath been offered, hath been withſtood: There hath been alſo anciently a League between another <note n="*" place="margin">The French.</note> Nation and the <hi>Scots,</hi> how uſeful to each others ſafety, both are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <p>Within theſe latter years an Union and Solemn League hath been had between us and them, no way croſſing or impeding any former League between them and any other Nation; neither matters it which Nation ours or theirs did heretofore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand our Union with the Scots; nor whether we have their firſt or ſecond Affections, as whether they wiſh better unto us, under the ſame Dominion with themſelves, or unto the French, their more ancient Colleagues, whileſt all three are at Amity within themſelves, which by Gods bleſſing as yet they are, and either Nation wiſe enough to diſcern and caſt out the Bone, likely to be caſt in to diſſolve the League.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:113760:20"/>
            <p> The Jealouſies for that purpoſe raiſed, have been many of late, as if the two Nations ſhould deal unjuſtly, ungratefully, and remiſſely each with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and againſt their Covenant, inſtancing as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Scots, <hi>for not taking the Town of</hi> HEREFORD <hi>the laſt Summer,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Which buſineſſe ſeems to depend upon the Queſtion, whether the county of <hi>HE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REFORD</hi> were not at that time an Enemy's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and the city ſcituate in the midſt thereof, bordering not far from a ſtrong and wel man'd Gariſon <hi>WORCE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STER,</hi> had not all means, whereof they made uſe, to reſiſt and repulſe ſtrangers beſieging them.</note> (to which their <hi>General</hi> hath given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, writing the Reaſon of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting from the Siege) A ſecond, which peradventure may be framed by ſome of the Engliſh, demanding <hi>what Service the Scots have done by their coming to aſsiſt?</hi> Which Queſtion is eaſily ſatisfied, when as the very Conjunction and League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Nations, did at firſt ſtrike terror into their Enemy, and hath been ſince one Temporal means of their many ſucceſſes. A third of a more large concernment, and might ſeem to carry a more plauſible objection againſt the Scots, of their thirſt and aim, to implant themſelves in this, as the more rich and fruitful Kingdom: On the other ſide, there may be Jealouſies inſinuated to the Scots againſt the Engliſh, of their dealing unjuſtly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully with the Scots, by promiſing, without gratifying them for their Aſſiſtance, when as both are able to juſtifie their Wiſdom and Integrity of being free from theſe and the like ſuggeſtions inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the Enemy, under colour of being Friends.</p>
            <p>It cannot be imagined, that it is the purpoſe of the Engliſh to neglect or diſcard, now they have ſerved their turn on their Friends the Scots, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſatisfaction for their Aſſiſtance (as the Boote-feaues
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113760:21"/> and Incendiaries, the common Enemies to both Nations, do give out) nor the purpoſe of the Scots to demand more, or to expect a preſent pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo much as hath been promiſed, the vaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Sums which the continuation of this War hath coſt, being taken into conſideration, the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Covenant entred into by both Nations, are ſecurity for their reciprocal and more juſt Affections: Who knows whether theſe finely contrived Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations ſpring not from a Malignant heart, driving the common Enemies Intereſt (<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>If there be any ſuch unjuſt dealing, ſuch endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring in either Nation to out-vy the other in Art and Subtilty; as for the one to demand above what is promiſed, or the other to deny what is juſtly due, on purpoſe to beget a Quarrel contrary to the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Covenant, had and made betwixt both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Curſed be they in the Town, curſed in the Field,</hi>

            <p>The miſchief and miſery indeed which inevitably muſt befall, in caſe they ſhall unhappily diſagree, will prove more fatal to the Subjects of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, then the preſent War betwixt the King and Parliament. The League betwixt them, the more ſtrict and Solemn, the more irreconcileable the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord when it happens, and nothing to compoſe the Quarrel when once began, beſides the Sword: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to prevent the beginning of the Quarrel, ſave only the forbearing and bearing each with other: The ſelf-denying quality, ſo much aſſumed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, is then exerciſed, and beſt proved in ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a patience, as is practiſed by a continued entire Union betwixt them both, and neither of them to arrogate wholly unto themſelves, the ſucceſſe of ſo much Conqueſt as hath been obtained: But if the <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </note> one ſhall think that their opulency and wealth ſhall wear and drive out the other, notwithſtanding their approved valor; or that the <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </note> other ſhall hope that their valor ſhall ſuppreſſe and conquer the Engliſh mens (not inferior to theirs) Theſe unhappy thoughts and attempts, if any ſuch upon deſtructive hopes muſt turn into miſery unto their Friends, Reproach and Obloquy to themſelves, a pleaſure and fulfilling their Enemies expected hopes, who will be ready to upbraid them with the common and old Proverb (as in the like caſe the conteſting between the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:113760:22"/> and <hi>Independent,</hi> to let in <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> again) <hi>[When Robbers fall out, true men come by their goods]</hi> meaning that a party of Engliſh and Scots having complot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to diveſt the King of his Soveraignty, and to take away his Regal Dignities, and now by variance within themſelves, his Majeſty hath regained his former Being.</p>
            <p>If any infinuate means of dividing the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions privily, and with excellency of Art, carried on by their ſeeming Friends, ſhall unhappily inure cloſely and inſenſibly to work this Miſchief, as for one Nation to upbraid and caſt Aſperſions on the other, of Inconſtancy, Ingratitude, Falſhood, and the like: What a new inteſtine War may happen hence, when either Nation ſhall have partakers at home, and abroad in Forraign parts? The Engliſh ſhall have Friends to credit what they ſay againſt the Scots, and they reciprocally againſt the Engliſh, and no time or ſeaſon amidſt theſe Commotions (the Enemy being vigilant and active to foment the Quarrel) to Examine or Diſpute the Truth, to ſet right the Miſapprehenſions of the particulars of ſuch Aſperſions, when the very fear entertained of late of a diſagreeing between the two Nations, hath appal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the hearts of their common Friends, and more ſet back and retarded the hopes of Succeſſe and Peace, then the News of Victories can forward them.</p>
            <p>As for other Differences which might ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Nations, touching ſome Punctilio's of Pre-eminence, or the like; King <hi>James</hi> therefore, of happy Memory, in his Star-Chamber Speech in <note place="margin">See the ſpeech.</note>

            <p>But to the Known Objections now in being, and publiſhed by the Common <note n="*" place="margin">Incendiaries and Fomentors of this War.</note> Enemy, as of an Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made of the Scots, as of Rebellion in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, when both Nations have been ſufferers, the Rights and Liberties of both violated, are ſtrange Objections in the judgement of ſtanders by; and to determine the truth of thoſe Objections, or on which ſide the Offenſive, on which the Defenſive is; there is not like to be any Umpire in the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>To expect a Forraigner to interecede or moderate (moſt of whom admit a ſenſible and compaſſionate affection in them towards theſe our Nations) their own and their nearer Friends Engagements, are enough to take up their own thoughts; beſides a wiſe, conſiderate and Politique State doth evidence their wiſdom, in not intermedling with the Affairs of others; rather when Troubles and Commotions are abroad, to look the more cloſely to their own, eſpecially in a Caſe of ſo nice a difference, as betwixt a King and a Parliament (the Repreſentative Body of the whole Kingdom) and each of them contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make good the Juſtice of their Quarrel. Nor is it probable, that any Prince of another Kingdom, will, in relation to himſelf (as making this difference betwixt the King and his Subjects here his own caſe) ſend over his Forces hither to aſſiſt a Vanquiſhed party: All Kingdoms have their ſeveral Forms of Government peculiar to every Nation, ſome of a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:113760:23"/> more abſolute and free, ſome of a more mixt kinde: The People know their Boundaries of Obedience, the Princes theirs of Power; and becauſe Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion is charged on the Subjects here, thoſe Princes of <hi>other</hi> Countreys, ſome think, will take part with the King of <hi>this,</hi> leaſt it ſhould prove a leading caſe to animate their Subjects alſo to Rebel. 'Tis two ways anſwered, The ſeveral Forms of Government in this and other Countreys, do diverſifie the caſe. Secondly, This is denyed, and no ways proved to be Rebellion.</p>
            <p>An exact and ſerene Judgement is hardly to be given by ſtrangers, not Natives, who dive not into the depth and ſtate of this preſent Quarrel, withall, the Conflict is ſeldom ſo equally carried, but that one ſide hath the better of it; then it is againſt the Rule of common Policy, to <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Noli in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducum parietem inclinare.</hi> Lip. Polit.</note> incline to the falling and weaker part, leaſt the ſtronger by their inclining be provoked to become their Enemies.</p>
            <p>Briefly, then the extreme terms, and conteſting parties in this War, are a Delinquent party on the one, and a Parliament (a Court of Judicature) on the other ſide; the firſt being conſcious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of ſeveral offences againſt the Common-wealth, and welfare of the Subject, contrive a courſe how to evade the hand of Juſtice, as by ſheltring themſelves under a ſtrong and ſupreme Power <hi>[The King]</hi> ſuggeſting ill offices betwixt him and that Court of Judicature, gaining thereby the better credit with the Adverſaries thereof: then by adviſing him the moſt likely ways of encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, namely, <hi>in betaking himſelf</hi> to ſome remoter
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:113760:23"/> place of ſtrength, which <hi>Advice</hi> was accordingly followed, and thereby his Majeſty better enabled to command the parts next adjacent to his reſidence, as at <hi>YORK</hi> the Northern: Then to require and Summon in ſuch other Countreys near unto him, as complyed not at the preſent with him in ſuch deſign as he purpoſed, as alſo to be diſpleaſed with other of his Subjects who took any averſe courſe to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, next to ſet up his Royal Standard at <hi>NOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINGHAM,</hi> that whoſoever dwelled near, and came not in to his party, were in danger of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
            <p>By this means his Forces might ſoon increaſe, whether Love or Fear the Motive; for when a Prince ſhall tell his Subjects near him of a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion (nothing then more noiſed by his party then <hi>Rebellion, Diſloyalty)</hi> and preparations by him made to ſubdue the <hi>Rebels,</hi> if he ſhall then require their Ayd, who dare refuſe? Theſe were the firſt parties in the Quarrel; by theſe means the Kings ſtrength might increaſe, the Parliaments abate: Hence grows the name of a Rebel, of a Traytor, the Kings party calling him a Rebel, who diſobeying the Kings Commands, reſiſts: The Parliament calling them <hi>Traytors, Vipers</hi> and <hi>Peſts</hi> to their King and Countrey, who perſwade and aſſiſt him in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the limits of the Laws; It is King <hi>Jame</hi>'s <note place="margin">In the ſame Speech in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, 1609.</note> definition; and who theſe be, Peace only and a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led time for Judicature can try.</p>
            <p>The Kings party accuſe the Parliament of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling and Hypocriſie, and with that earneſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, as if they did exceed all others in that ſin:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:113760:24"/> How eaſie a thing it is for either part to rail or ſcoff, to call the advers part <hi>Rebel, Hypocrite?</hi> How eaſie alſo to ſtain the beſt and moſt honeſt Intentions with the nick-name of <hi>Diſſembler, Hypocrite?</hi> Envy and ill-will can revile and accuſe the beſt purpoſes; and Goodneſſe when it is quarrelled with muſt be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termed, otherwiſe the quarreller would bluſh to oppoſe or wrong it: Nay, a bare cenſuring ſerves not, it muſt be aggravated to higher terms, <hi>as never ſo notable and artificial a piece of Diſſembling, to contrive and compoſe Treaſon, to palliate a Rebellion;</hi> which is granted, and as much confeſſed, if a Rebellion, if a Treaſon: Malice and Contumely are of an ambient and large Circumference and Interpretation; it is within the compaſſe of their liberty to give out in Speeches, That the Parliament is the certain and only cauſe of theſe Diſtempers; that every one well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſhing to that Court, is a Rebel to the King; that he who fights not in a preſent and impetuous way for the King, is a Neutral; that he who ſoberly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing what he knows or hath obſerved concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Diſtractions, if it hath not made altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the King, againſt the Parliament, is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, an Incendiary, or hath any way aſſiſted the Parliament, or his Countrey to defend it, is lyable to the cenſure of a Traytor: In which Crime there being no Acceſſaries, he is a Principal.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe very few have demeaned themſelves ſo warily, but ſhall finde an Enemy to accuſe him, were it but for hopes to purchaſe redemption to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the Accuſer as guilty as the Accuſed.</p>
            <p>Some neighboring Counties fearing that the like
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:113760:24"/> Calamity might fall on them as on other parts of the Kingdom, agreed like firm Friends and Servants to their Countrey, in a joynt and mutual League to defend it againſt all formidable Force which might infeſt them: To this mutual defence divers Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Free-holders ſubſcribed their Hands, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Aſſociating, the better to maintain their ſtrength: Others refuſed to ſubſcribe, as being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from ſubſcribing by the more able ſort of Gentlemen of the Neighborhood, engaged for the King, at which time the King had an Army abroad; wherefore, whoſoever offered to reſiſt and repulſe that Army, might come within the compaſſe of the Statute of the 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. An ordinary and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent foreſight might have prevented many and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Miſchiefs, when as if other adjoyning Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had in like maner mutually agreed, as it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed unto them, they had not been ſo harraſſed and ſpoiled as now they are.</p>
            <p>But as the caſe now ſtands, what is to be done? The Aſſociations are entred into, the hands of the Subſcribers to be ſeen, or inquiſition to be made for all who did Subſcribe, whether hopes of Pardon to be procured by Price or Friends, or to ſtand to the innocency of their own hearts? If by Price, who then the gainer? Informers, Promooters: Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhall get more by Pardons, Fines and Forfeitures then the Exchequer, or other his Majeſties Courts of Revenue can: If by Friendſhip, the extremity of theſe falſe and deſperate times will break through ſuch Obligations of Friendſhip, Truth, or Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity, that few either can or will aſſiſt each other

            <p>But to look back to the preſent ſubject of this Quarrel, and the ſeveral charges wherewith the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting parties ſtand accuſed: The ſubſtance of the charge wherein the Parliament are called Traytors by the Kings party, is <hi>their oppoſing his Crown and Dignity;</hi> yea ſome go farther, <hi>their purpoſe to deſtroy his Perſon,</hi> wherefore, as guilty of ſuch Treaſon, to be oppoſed and fought againſt.</p>
            <p>The Argument, it is hoped and prayed for, is from flalſly ſuggeſted premiſes, unknown, ungrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which Arguings are Fallacies, and may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to divide the King and the Parliament, for the Reaſons before expreſſed, ſo to engage the People to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:113760:25"/> take part with the Accuſers; yet no queſtion the Quarrel is grown ſo full of bitterneſſe and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, as if the PARLIAMENT be born down, there will not want Witneſſes to prove ſuch Treaſon.</p>
            <p>The <hi>OXFORD</hi> Mercury indeed makes himſelf and his Readers merry with this Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; he Jeſts and ſayes, <hi>They diſcharged and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled their greateſt Canon at the King to preſerve his Honor and Perſon;</hi> The PARLIAMENTS ſad thoughts take no notice of his ſcoffing humor, they leave him to make himſelf and his Friends merry by his Jeſting.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the King hath in his Perſon ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſeveral Battels much againſt the ſupplication and importunity of his Subjects: If two Armies do pitch a field, the one earneſtly diſſwading the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of ſome eminent perſon in the other for fear of danger to that perſon, if notwithſtanding he ſhall unneceſſarily expoſe himſelf to hazzard, and look that the advers Army ſhall forbear to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in reſpect to that perſons ſafety, ſo to lye themſelves at the mercy of the Enemy, or not to fight at all, no man in this caſe will think they intend to fight againſt that perſon.</p>
            <p>From ſuch reproachful Obſervations as that <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> ſuggeſts, and the Enemies to the Parliament may invent, the Court muſt deeply ſuffer cenſure, if born down under ſome ignominious attribute even to poſterity, as that Parliament in <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth's time, branded with <hi>Indoctum,</hi> another with <hi>Inſanum,</hi>

            <p>Such, and the like calumnies are like to be their fate in caſe they are vanquiſhed. But to return and view the charge whereof the King and his party are ſuſpected, which before it be treated on; The duty required from the people, by the two conteſting parts (the King, the Parliament) is examinable; ſeeing a War is waged, and ſuch a one as diſſolves all laws, and the quarrel ſo bitterly purſued betwixt the King and the Parliament, both requiring Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obedience: which is to be obeyed, the King a ſupreme but ſingle perſon, or the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the repreſentative body of the Kingdom, in number many? which to be obeyed in point of ſafety and conſcience?</p>
            <p>But firſt to make the Queſtion the more clear, take theſe <note n="*" place="margin">The peoples Plea.</note> collections, from a learned Divine, <hi>That the King hath His Power from the Kingdom, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore His Authority; which Tearms, though common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confounded if diſtinguiſhed, makes clear the matter: For Authority is a Right and Lawfulneſſe to command Obedience, ſuch as all Governors and Magiſtrates have more or leſſe; But Power is a lawful Ability to force obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, where upon command it is denied; one may have a just and lawful right to command, that wants compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive means for Coertion; others may have ſtrength to force (commonly called Power) that wants Authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:113760:27"/> 
               <hi>and Power is that which in all Government bears the ſway: Wherefore in the Scripture</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>and els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, it is taken concretively for the Governors and Magiſtrates themſelves, which have power at command, to force Obedience to their Commands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now there is no doubt but the King hath ful Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to command according unto Law, all ſuch as are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Him by Law; but if upon His command obedience be denied, whence hath he lawful power to enforce obedience, whence hath He His Power to make good His Authority but from the people? He cannot have it from Himſelf being but one man: To keep a ſtrong guard of ſome of His people, to impugn and force the reſt, muſt needs produce Commotions, Inſurrections, and a Civil-War; If of ſtrangers, the Philoſopher and others who write of Policy,</hi>

               <hi>will tell you it is Tyranny: nor is ſuch ability</hi> Poteſtas, <hi>but</hi> vis, <hi>violence, not power, becauſe unlawful: when</hi> vis <hi>and</hi> Poteſtas, <hi>or</hi> vis <hi>and</hi> jus <hi>do claſh and skirmiſh, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is dangerous: To keep an Army on foot continually, under other pretences, thereby to affright and force the Subjects, is litle better; therefore the Kings power muſt needs come from His own peoples hands and ſtrength, and from the ſame people muſt come His Authority. If any other ſhould give him Authority, that were not able to make it good by power, it were given Him in vain, nor were the people bound to make that good which themſelves gave not: whence He hath His power then, from thence He muſt needs receive His Authority, even from the Kingdom.</hi>

            <p>'Tis reſolved, <hi>Securius expediuntur negotia commiſſa pluribus, &amp; oculi plus vident quam oculus,</hi> which is not conſtrued of the quantity of degree, as which is higheſt, which greateſt? but of the quantity of number, which moſt probable to provide for the common good, one or many?</p>
            <p>If it be objected, <hi>That the King hath a Councel,</hi> viz. <hi>his Privy Councel to aſsiſt and conſult with.

            <p>Yea, let this be taken for granted, as advantage to his Majeſties party, whether ſo or not, That the Major part of the Peers and Gentry are now with the King, in ſome other place then where he firſt Summoned them: Admit it be true, yet that they were called by his Writ to attend the ſervice at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place and time, and both place and time named in that Writ, where the Attendance is according to that Summons, and they having all there met according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:113760:28"/> the place and time do define and limit the Action, denominating thoſe the Parliament which there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide: For howbeit a great number be come away from the place whereto they were firſt Summoned, whether ſolicited, awed, or otherwiſe engaged, the reſiding part to that number which now ſit there make a full Parliament.</p>
            <p>'Tis no marvel if their number ſhall decreaſe, their courage fail them, when ſo proclaimed againſt and threatned, as might terrifie men of much reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and conſtancy, when their Poſterities and Eſtates are expoſed to Ruine, all poſſible means of Art and might, nothing left unattempted to awe and conquer them; and which they judge moſt hard, that Proclamations forbidding all Traffique unto the place of their ſitting; that other Meſſages, ſome requiring Obedience, others threatning, and ſent them where they ſit, to be debarr'd the publiſhing their Reaſon and Anſwer of not obeying, which they cannot communicate, thereby to ſatisfie the Kingdom, in that all commerce and intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and them is inhibited by thoſe his Proclamations.</p>
            <p>Fear of a Prince's diſpleaſure is a note of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſubjection, no leſſening their juſt courage, the Parliament have manifeſted both Submiſſion, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: Courage, in not yielding when they were weakeſt; Submiſſion, in not refuſing to Treat when ſtrongeſt: Former Princes have been beſt pleaſed to own ſuch Subjects, <hi>men of Valor and Conſtancy,</hi> not terming thoſe vertues <hi>Rebellion, Treaſon,</hi> when as <hi>Rebellion</hi> rightly underſtood, may be againſt a

[The King, although a Supreme Perſon, yet a Subject to Infirmity.]</p>
            <p>The ſeveral threatnings publiſhed, and violence offered, the Houſes of Parliament may well grow thin, when thoſe of the Kings party contend to make his Power abſolute and unlimited, thence in him to <hi>Puniſh, Pardon and Reward</hi> at pleaſure: In him alſo, or in themſelves, to <hi>Judge</hi> alone, the conſideration whereof might invite many to his party, who at firſt deliberatively, upon advice and beſt judgement, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed their duty and affections to the Parliament, ſince finding their ſtrength decreaſed by the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of many their fellow Members, might think it unſafe to ſtay themſelves.</p>
            <p>They could not but foreſee that the King offering to remove the Houſes of Parliament to ſome other place, the City of <hi>LONDON</hi> would be quarreled with as harboring thoſe whom his Majeſty calls <hi>his</hi>

            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, there was at that time which his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſpeaks of, a great concourſe of people about <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and <hi>White-hall,</hi> and the <hi>Londoners</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing long, as many Subjects elſewhere did, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heavy preſſures of Injuſtice, implored his Majeſty and the Houſes of Parliament for redreſſe, every one being earneſt to have Juſtice done with the firſt opportunity of the Parliaments ſitting.</p>
            <p>They might peradventure preſs too near and rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his preſence; but whether his Actions after ſuch removing ſuited with the Inſtructions of that Letter then ſent when the Jealouſies did firſt begin, let all men judge.</p>
            <p>The Orators opinion was, <hi>Nothing ſo elegant or</hi>

               <hi>ſo harſh or horrid, but the eloquence of words can mitigate and excuſe:</hi> The impetuous coming of great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Armed men with Swords and Piſtols fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the King when he came to the Houſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to demand the ſix Impeached Members, is by vertue of milde language the <note n="*" place="margin">In the Kings Anſwer to the Declaration from the Lords and Commons 1642.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Which by the way, the diſaffection born by his Majeſty to the City, the place of the Parliaments ſitting, preſaged all poſſible means to be deviſed of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the place and the Parliament met there, which could not be better managed, then by excepting againſt <hi>that,</hi> and adjourning to ſome other place.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak it plainly, it was the Cities Aſſiſtance and Affection to the Parliament which cauſed the Anger (for, be it ſpoken to their perpetual Glory) the happy correſpondence betwixt the City (the place of ſecurity for that Court) and that Courts conſulting for the Cities and the Publique good, hath hitherto, next under Gods Protection, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Both, the City and the Parliament.</p>
            <p>It follows next in point of Conſcience, which is to be obeyed, the King divided from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or the Parliament? as the King is the Head and eminent part of the Parliament, the Parliament the Heart of the King; although the Head may be forceably or otherwiſe turned then the Heart directs, the Heart is nevertheleſſe the ſame, nor to be thought divided from the Head; Wherefore the Parliament reſiding there where it was firſt Summoned, and the King there

            <p>Herewith ſuits the <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> Apoſtles exhortatory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſubjection to the higher Powers: Powers they are (without doubt) high alſo and eminent, otherwiſe the Countreys made an ill choyce out of eminent perſons to elect inferior and mean men to enact Laws.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles text forecited, intendeth not a King ſimply in His perſon only, but all powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor them, as governors in whatſoever they do, but for the reaſon there ſubjoyned; Their juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors, as being <hi>the Miniſters of God for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects good, to take vengeance of evil doers;</hi> otherwiſe Saint <hi>Peter</hi> his peremptory text <hi>[It is better to obey</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But to the difference in the object of obedience, obedience is (in common judgement) moſt due to that power which is freeſt from the poſſibility of Error: A King may ſooner erre then a Parliament may; no man can ſimply accuſe that Court of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Actions of injuſtice; for whatſoever they do Eſtabliſh or Ordain, is made juſt and lawful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, in that <hi>they</hi> do it, whileſt we live and are born under laws: They may by ſome latter Act re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal or moderate the rigour of an ancient or former Law without Error, or injuſtice doing.</p>
            <p>The managing their courſe of enforcing, of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing upon the Subjects Liberty and Right, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring him to contribute to the maintenance of this War, may not altogether unfitly be reſembled to the courſe of a skilful Chirurgion, who when a Patient's leg being broke is ill ſet, he breaks the leg anew, although with torture to the Patient; his reaſon of breaking the ſame again, is to ſet that right, which by ill ſetting was diſplaced: The Parliament findes the Laws broken, juſtice turned out of it's propper channel, they in the proſecution of a War neceſſarily to be maintained for the recovery and reſtauration of the Laws to their former ſtate, break thoſe Laws again: they enforce the ſubjects to pay the charge of Souldiers raiſed therefore, not with an intent to continue ſuch exactions, but only du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this time of War, which by the peoples free ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the Parliaments impoſitions will the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:113760:31"/> ſooner end, the one not laying heavier loads then the Subjects can bear, nor the Subjects repining at what the Parliament ſhal impoſe; and all upon a ſerious and juſt debate of what may fall out but neceſſary for a War being to be waged in defence of the Laws, Government and Proteſtant Religion, which by ſubtil and ſecret practiſes hath been long ſince op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned: who is to bear the charges of the War, but they for whoſe ſake and ſafety it is raiſed? <hi>Qui ſentit commodum, ſentire etiam debet &amp; onus,</hi> money is the ſinews of War; War the end of Peace, Peace the Subjects Bleſſing: if he voluntarily contribute not, and be enforced, it is no impeachment of his Liberty; and whither a War be to be waged, is the reſult of this Diſcourſe.</p>

            <p> The affections of the people are for the moſt part meaſured by the deportment of the Prince, ſo reciprocal is the obligation, ſo natural the relation betwixt a King and His Subjects; and how deſirous His Majeſties Predeceſſors have been of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects love, is freſh in Memory: They knew, and were protected by it, that <hi>Fides magis tuetur, quam ſatellitium,</hi> their Subjects affections to be a ſurer Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark then their own Guard.

Nor one Town more Loyal then another, or more Malignant (taking the Malignancy againſt which ſide you will) ſaving where ſome obnoxious perſons of Eminency or Power hath Pre-eminence above the reſt, or where a chief Town in a County ſince this War began, hath a more ſtout and expert Commander in it, to Govern and keep the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Force oppoſing it: wherefore what a miſtake it is to call this Countrey or Town, more or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:113760:33"/> leſſe Malignant, more or leſſe Loyal, when as all men in a natural duty do and deſire to ſerve the Countrey wherein they are born and live.</p>
            <p>The Orator excepting againſt the eaſe and quiet <note place="margin">Cicer.</note> of many men, did long ſince direct them in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude which they owe unto their Birth and Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diſtributing their Duty and Endeavors into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral portions, <hi>Partem Parentes, Partem Amici, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Patria vendicat,</hi> what their Countrey is, what the Repreſentative Body, is already declared.

            <p>Which terms of Malignant, Loyal, unqueſtioned before this War began, hath much diſtempered the Common-wealth, and ſet a difference even between the neareſt Friends: where Nature and Deſert hath put an Unity, Malice and Miſtakings hath made Diſſention, that it falls out in theſe Kingdoms as <hi>in Iſrael and Judah, two parts of a Nation, we are no longer a Tribe and a Tribe, but we are divided Kinred againſt Kinred, Family againſt Family, Son againſt his Father, a Daughter againſt her Mother, and a mans Foes to be thoſe of his own Houſe:</hi> Nay, it is a more inteſtine Diſcord, betwixt a man, as it were, and himſelf, the Body and the Minde, between the outward Eſtate and inward Conſcience: When a man to ſave his Eſtate ſhall expoſe his Conſcience, having premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately and on judgement reſolved to betake himſelf to one ſide; ſoon after for fear of loſing his Eſtate, or upon the turn of Victory, hath ſubmitted to the other, againſt the conſent of his own heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>

            <p> The proſecution of which War hath had ſeveral riſes and beginnings, many paſſages to increaſe and adde fuel to the Contention; the Kings party al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways croſſing and altering, even in matters Arbitrary and Indifferent, what the King and Parliament did on good reaſon inſtitute.</p>
            <p>Others of more moment, as namely, His <note n="*" place="margin">See the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the large Treaty, pag. 16. De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mand 4. grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, Auguſt, 1641.</note> Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties gracing and preferring to His neareſt ſecreſie and truſt, a perſon whom His Majeſty and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did accuſe and Proclaim guilty of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>Divers other matters of debate might happen to inflame the Diſcord, one more particularly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably concerning the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who in the Diſpute whether he ſhould ſuffer or not, had gained the moſt powerful and eminent Members, as he thought, of both Houſes of Parliament on his ſide, and the King to intercede as far as he might with Juſtice to acquit the Earl. A ſixth part at the moſt of the Members againſt the Sentence of his ſuffering, might be peradventure troubled that their power and ſuffrages were over-matched, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much that they could not prevail to acquit the Earl, have probably nouriſhed thence an emulous ſpirit towards their fellow-Members; the Debate whereof could not but adde unto the fuel of theſe Diſſentions, and ſo prove a proſecution of this War.</p>
            <p>Thus the fire of War being kindled, two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal parties have appeared in a martial poſture: And which firſt began, unto whom was violence firſt offered, in robbing and ſpoyling and the like, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:113760:34"/> ſeverally according to the affections of the Reporters; a juſt eſtimate without varying in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of conſiderableneſſe is hardly to be had: The King and His party ſay he <hi>intended no War,</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſayes, <hi>Their's is defenſive only,</hi> the Proverb is <hi>[The ſecond blow makes the affray]</hi> the firſt it is ſure gives the offence: The Kings coming in a Warlike manner, attended with ſo many armed men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſix impeached Members, reſembled as much as for that preſent might be a Warlike act: But a Warlike act and a War differ, not much more then a diſpoſition to a habit and a habit to it ſelf; 'Tis true, there wanted time and preparations to make it a perfect War, and neither <hi>WESTMINSTER</hi> nor <hi>LONDON</hi> were a fit ſcene for War, the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were elſwhere made in many parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by men who have been active for His party; and large contributors to this War againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, have evidenced the ſymptomes of a War, and their aſſiſtance whenſoever it ſhould be waged.</p>
            <p>To prove the Kings aſſertion, that <hi>He in His Perſon intended no War;</hi> divers of His Nobility then attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Him have <note n="*" place="margin">See their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation at <hi>York,</hi> Iune 1642.</note> atteſted it under their hand writing: which the Court of Parliament urges as too light a proof to diſcharge their Truſt, or to ſecure three Kingdoms by; a Civil War being then in agitation, the ſeed already ſown.</p>
            <p>Who (may they ſay) can witneſſe or be ſecurity for another mans intentions? for what another man doth purpoſe in his heart? or who being preſent with the King dare call in queſtion His ſincerity: tis all one to tell Him <hi>He is falſe or wicked; a Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:113760:35"/> 
               <hi>is as the roaring of a Lyon:</hi> If two or three begin, what third, fourth or more will refuſe to joyn in the atteſting it being preſent there? His Majeſties heart may be peaceable and ſincere, but a Certificate from thoſe Lords is no <hi>Medium</hi> to prove it ſo: Thoſe Lords it's like had a cheap eſteem of their fellow-Lords and Commons, and might well think fit ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be quarrelled then joyned with: if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the ſupreameſt Court of Judicature and Truſt, ſhall ſo ſlighly diſcharge their Truſt, as to place the Peace and ſecurity of three Kingdoms on ſo eaſie a proof, as a few, though very Honorable Gentlemen, to deliver what their opinion barely was concerning the Kings intentions, a diſcord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing and a Civil War in view, His Majeſty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated, as it was feared, a party ready to joyn with Him, ſome whereof having taken part with Him in His firſt aſſault, others of the like condition to aſſiſt Him on pretence of Loyalty, the Parliament Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, many of them being accuſed of high miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors, and few ſcarce free from the incurſion of His Majeſties diſpleaſure, the debate concerning the Earl of <hi>Straffords</hi> trial being ſcarſe wiped out, were neceſſitated as well in their own defence, as in the peoples involved in theirs, to take up Arms to keep off thoſe ſtorms already acted and attempted; which if they had not done and timouſly provided (a face of War appearing) againſt the like aſſaults, it would have been thought a weakneſſe of ſpirit, or want of prudence if they had deſiſted; beſides the happineſſe, as to us, which probably might have accrewed by the aſſembling a Parliament, muſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113760:35"/> have turned unto much unhappineſſe by the affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and overthrowing this; as to the Parliament, how incompetent it had been to their judgement, in caſe the Truſt repoſed in them, and the important Affairs of the Kingdom (the end of their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling) ſhould have miſcarried through their credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; to have made no better return of their wiſdom, the peoples truſt, then for them to have excuſed the ſame by ſaying, <hi>[We had not thought it would have ſo faln out.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Acts of Violence and Injuſtice, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the partakers in this War, as of Robbing, Spoyling, and the like, who firſt began, the Kings party or the Parliaments? They accuſe each other of the firſt breach of Juſtice; The Kings party aver, <hi>The Lady</hi> Savage's <hi>Houſe in</hi> ESSEX <hi>to be the firſt which was aſſaulted and ſpoyled of much of her Goods and Houſhold-ſtuffe, to an exceeding value:</hi> Whether ſo or not, or the <hi>Earl of</hi> Stamfords <hi>Houſe in</hi> Leiceſterſhire, as the Parliament party urges, the caſe is of a differing quality: For howbeit there may be Injuſtice in the one, as in the other act of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laging; The Lady <hi>Savage</hi> being a known and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict Recuſant, a Law in force for diſarming Papiſts, and His Majeſties Proclamation of Diſplea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:113760:36"/> and Pillage her, as is urged.</p>
            <p>Theſe particular acts could not but foreſhew a war, which ſince hath happened; and ſetting thoſe aſide, the Queſtion is, on which ſide the offenſive is: The extreme terms and parties in this Quarrel, are a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent party on the one, and a Parliament (a Court of Judicature) on the other ſide; or (if the King will againſt His Subjects will, and their humble im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuning Him, make himſelf a party) betwixt a King, and the greater part of His Kingdom; the Parliament only the Umpire to judge and moderate the Quarrel.</p>
            <p>A War thus happening, and parties thus engaged, 'tis not now who firſt intended an Offenſive, who a Defenſive War; but who firſt executed a Warlike act, or appeared <hi>modo guerrino</hi> (which the Laws do forbid to Subjects, and the King the Defender of thoſe Laws) to make the offended party provide for themſelves; the King againſt the Parliament, or the Parliament againſt the King? The Parliament to bring offendors unto Tryal (the end and reaſon of their Aſſembling) to ſit as a ſpeculative and ignavous Court, or to diſſolve, as having nothing within their Power to do, could not in an ordinary and uſual courſe ſummon and reach offendors: Themſelves proſcribed and proclaimed againſt as Traytors, were enforced to take up Arms, as well for their own as the peoples ſafety, which if they did not, and in time provide againſt their Ruine, they had had no other Reward for the preſent, but pity from their Friends, and ſcorn from their Enemies. The fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inconveniences might have been as fatal, like a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:113760:36"/> Conſumption leiſurely to ſpend the body; or as a Civil War, like a burning Feaver, ſuddenly to kill it.</p>
            <p>They then upon foreſight of what they could not avoid, but either to purſue the Juſtice of their Cauſe by Arms, or to deſiſt and ſubmit to the mercy of their Enemies, provide and ſend forth an able, faithful <hi>General,</hi> proved by his Proweſſe in reſcuing and relieving a beſieged <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>GLOUCESTER,</hi> ſtoutly and like an expert Commander relieved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; as vigilantly and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly defended by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor within.</note> Town or Fort when the Enemy had well nigh prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Next after him they ſend forth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Puiſſant and Dexterous in his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, with other Officers and Commanders belonging to an Army, hazarding their own perſons and Eſtates, to try whether the Countreys which have choſen and ſent them on their work, would now defend and aſſiſt them in imminence of danger in the Cauſe of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Laws, the Subjects Liberty, the Power and Priviledge of Parliament.</p>
            <p>In the Interruption of whoſe Endeavors, a War is waged, a Conflict entred into, two parties oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite engaged, and the Victory hath been therefore doubtful, by reaſon of the equal ſtrength in the one for the King and Parliament, with the other for the King againſt the Parliament; both ſides equal in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and worth.</p>
            <p>The odds only, in that thoſe for the King and Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament contend not peradventure in ſo temporary, ſeeming, and immediate a way of Service, as thoſe for the King againſt the Parliament, in their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and inconſiderate heat, amongſt their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:113760:37"/> beſt accepted, as having at firſt ſight a more ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teſt of Loyalty, more dreadful to the advers part, as being the more full of cruelty.</p>
            <p>Thoſe for the King would not be thought Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to a Parliament, in a direct and immediate op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to that Court (for all ſeem to reverence the Law and the Law makers) but conſequently and forſeeingly what courſe the Parliament did take to ſuppreſſe Abuſes and Exorbitances in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which haply thoſe advers perſons might be guilty of.</p>
            <p>The Adverſaries to which Court are branched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral ſorts; the Verſes found at their firſt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, declaring what Members were competent alone for imployment in the Parliament, glanced at many of thoſe who were likely to prove advers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
<q>
                  <l>No Church-Papiſt; no Court Atheiſt.</l>
                  <l>No Fen Dreyner; nor Lords Reteiner.</l>
                  <l>No man commended from the Lawn Sleeve;</l>
                  <l>Nor Ship-money collecting Sheriff.</l>
               </q> out of which ſome choſen, have approved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves firm Friends and Patriots to their Countrey.</p>
            <p>Beſides, theſe recited in theſe Rimes, are,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Obnoxious and guilty perſons, corrupt in place and Office, therefore troubled to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd by a Superior power who might examine their Demeanors: Amongſt which numbers, ſome not from the firſt, or habitually offending, but for ſome later and particular act of Inconſtancy, having erred, perſiſt therein, in forſaking the truſt in them repoſed.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:113760:37"/>
            <p> 2. Others of ambitious and aſpiring thoughts, or of a proud conciet or envy, ſcorning to partake with others their Equals in opinion, thinking with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that it ſmels too much of the Yeoman, of a Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and vulgar quality, to take part with or ſerve their Countrey.</p>
            <p>3. Some through Levity and Humor, of a croſſe and advers condition, affecting Paradoxes, venting thence the ſtrength of their own wit, and boldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcanting on the Court of Parliament &amp; their actions, as if the more Honorable that Court is, the more fit a Combitant for their great wits to foyn and fence with.</p>
            <p>4. Others from an ill will and diſaffection to ſome perſon of the Parliaments ſide, which the diſaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hope may prove Rebellion in ſuch perſon, have therefore adhered to the King againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>5. Others not much differing from theſe, who ſeeing their immediate Anceſtor (Father, Brother, or ſome other unto whom they are next in Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or near in Blood) to have aſſiſted the King and Parliament, therefore in danger to be queſtioned, and knowing it to be in the King to <hi>Puniſh</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> hoping for Reverſion of ſuch Eſtate upon their Anceſtors Attainder, have therefore aſſiſted the King againſt the Parliament.</p>
            <p>6. Others of the like mould, dividing as it were by contract, and ſuiting their affections, as the father to the one, the ſon to the other ſide, ſo the one is to be a ſaver by the bargain, let the victory fall out which way it will: This is the eaſieſt and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:113760:38"/> way of Policy, if there be any who practice it; if I had ſaid the worſt way to, it had been no wrong done to the Contractors, becauſe the War hath been by no means ſo much protracted as by the Collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intereſts; Conſcience and Judgement being excluded.</p>
            <p>7. Others who having lived in Forraign Countries of a more free and abſolute Government then this mixt Monarchy is, deeming all manner of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence due in whatſoever a King commands, becauſe it hath been paid to the King where theſe perſons have lived, and ſeeing <hi>That</hi> univerſal obedience denied to our King as matters now ſtand, have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſettled their affections to His party, and having ſo ſetled, think it now an undervaluing their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to alter their opinion.</p>
            <p>8.

            <p>But how to avoid the charge of the above recited Proclamations, leaving none unpardoned of the city; theſe men may imagine that they play their game moſt cunningly, and truſting on pardons underhand, may prove Enemies to their fellow-Citizens, who joyntly acting for the Cities good, theſe men, it is to be feared, do countermine and work againſt the ſame.</p>

            <p>The Concord ſhould be as the Obligation is, general and reciprocal, for the mutual ſafety of the whole Body Politique: the City hath a long time been as famous as any in <hi>EUROPE</hi> for their <note n="*" place="margin">More remarkably mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in this inſtant happy and well framed Vnion and Agreement prudently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the miſchiefs which might have befallen in caſe they had not agreed as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſociety, notwithſtanding the many and ſeveral ſorts of diviſions occaſioned by theſe Commotions.</note> wiſdom in all things expedient for their ſtate &amp; dignity, in their mutual traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique with all parts of Chriſtendom: and they are unworthy of their protection, or to be entertained within their Limits, who wiſheth not their continual flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing: To divide, thereby to loſe ſo

            <p>As to their latter reaſon of theſe mens diſpleaſure againſt the Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> their feeling of heavy payments, or of one mans peradventure more heavy then his Neighbors: It is a bleſſing, and ſo it is termed, that they, and other parts of the Kingdom within the Juriſdiction of the Parliament, do enjoy <hi>Peace within their Walls, and Plenteouſneſs within their Precincts,</hi> as a Reward due for their Aſſociation and Accord, although they pay for it; whereas many Towns and Countreys elſewhere pay for dearly, even to their undoings, yet want that happineſſe.</p>

The Parliament in their juſt Eſtimate of what concerns the Clergy, might have promoted the encouragement of Learning in a more equal diſtribution of Church-Livings then now it is, without taking away the right of preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from the true Patron; yet by providing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lyon-like fellowſhip, as the Proverb is, <hi>Some all, ſome never a whit,</hi> or which is as bad, that the more lazy and unlearned may not abound with what the more painful and learned want: No indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent man will think that there can be ſuch an envy and diſproportionate dealing in a prudent Laity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to Reform, towards a learned Clergy, the inſtrumental means of Reformation, as that the one ſhould check, or diſcourage the growth and ſtudy of the other.</p>
            <p>The wiſe and pious judgement of King <hi>James</hi> is yet freſh in memory, which He left as a Legacy to Poſterity, of the eſteem and reverence due and not to be denied to the Clergy of this Land, ſpeaking in His diſcourſe of the Laws of this Kingdom, of Gods own Laws, which His Majeſty did then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain <hi>were too much neglected, and Church-men had too</hi>

            <p>But of theſe kinde of advers perſons laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, there be two ſorts, the one an ignorant and proud, which commonly go together, the more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant the more proud; The Gale of their empty Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour were retarded in their aſpiring Courſe, if their Bottoms were Ballaſſed with the ſolid part of man, <hi>Humility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other a learned and judicious ſort, ſome of whom alſo may be Enemies, making it a common Cauſe of engaging all Schollars againſt that Court, on this ſurmiſe even now cleared <hi>[That by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments endeavoring to reſtrain the Plurality of Church-Livings, and the perſonal corruptions of Biſhops, all learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the</hi> Seminaries <hi>thereof, the</hi> Univerſities, <hi>are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Univerſities</hi> partake of this adverſneſſe and diſaffection, as conceiving the Parliament would have made a more ſtrict Inquiſition into their Demeanor, then the <hi>Viſitors</hi> of <hi>Colledges</hi> their remiſſe Indulgency hath of latter times afforded: The corruptions of thoſe <hi>Seminaries</hi> is not ſo much of it ſelf, as of the negligent and diſcontinued over-ſight in thoſe whoſe proper charge it is to ſuper-intend their courſe and maners.</p>
            <p>Their Founders Munificent and Pious care from the firſt Inſtitution of their benign intendments, did purpoſe nothing more then an induſtrious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable courſe of life in the educating youth, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:113760:41"/> Schollars for the Church and Common-wealth: which if the Founders purpoſes be through neglect and corruption of times perverted, and that many the Fellows of Colledges there, degenerating into a lazy and unprofitable life, contrary to the Founders intent; it were a blemiſh to the Government of a prudent and wiſe State, finding out the Malady, to paſſe it by without enquiring into the Cure.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the number of the parties in this Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, all mens Actions or Affections being engaged, there be others advers enough, although warily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it, and diſaffecting the one ſide to the heigth, yet lying at a more ſubtile and cloſe lock (the <hi>Priſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianiſts, Tu omnes Te nemo)</hi> they know all men, no man them, and in their own eye play their game moſt cunningly, contented to temper and tune their Tongues ſuitable to the perſons with whom they do converſe, and to comply for the preſent with that ſide which they diſaffect, yet reſerve an advers heart when opportunity ſhall ſerve: Theſe men ſhould not take it ill, if that ſide, when prevailing, ſhall deal with them in the like kinde, to give them good words, yet know them for their Enemies.</p>
            <p>Divers alſo of a luke-warm temper, not Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but Neutral, rather <hi>Iſſachar like, couching down betwixt two Burthens,</hi> reſerving the tribute of their affections for the ſtronger ſide (their condition not unlike to Water-men in a rough Tide, Rowing for ſafety from one Shore to another) yet diſcerning the difference of the Cauſe in queſtion, and in their judgements ſatisfied which is the more juſt, do weigh withall, whoſe Actions, the Kings parties or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:113760:41"/> the Parliaments are the more Cruel, and for fear of that which is the more cruel, betake themſelves to that, preſuming upon the Lenity of the more milde and merciful, as not likely to exceed the Limits of Juſtice in their puniſhings.</p>
            <p>Others of mixt affections adhering to the King in ſome of His Tenents, to the Court of Parliament in ſome of theirs, and none ſo ſure a lover to the Parliament, or Adverſary to the King, but will think that <hi>the Parliament in ſome of their tranſient Acts may deviate and go aſtray: The Kings party may in other things maintain a probable right;</hi> yet that doth not diſtinguiſh theſe mens affections, or make them leſſe vehement to the party they affect: For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme and adequate terms in this Diviſion, are an actual invading the Subjects Right, ſetled by an Ancient and Fundamental Law on the one, and an endeavoring to maintain and preſerve the ſame on the other part.</p>
            <p>The other Diſputes between the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, concerning Church-Government and the manner of Divine Worſhip, are collateral only, and incident to this contention, and might have been left unqueſtioned and intire, had not this War touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a more principall object happened, and may ſoon yet be reconciled, when as little different in themſelves.</p>
            <p>And theſe men miſtermed luke-warm or neutral, will approve themſelves as affectionate and conſtant to the Parliament, as any of thoſe who miſterm and cenſure them.</p>
            <p>And of this ſort many there are who have wiſely
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:113760:42"/> and warily carried themſelves, with fervour and conſtancy to that part, although commended in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent envious way, and taken notice of by their enviers, repining at their well-doing, for <hi>playing their game ſo wiſely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divers alſo of the other ſide (to comprehend them all in a few words) ignorant, peeviſh and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in manners as in judgement, as Schiſmatiques and Sectaries, ſnarling at and <hi>deſpiſing all Government,</hi> are ſeeming to adhere to the Parliament againſt the King, it is ſure againſt His Government; no friends to the Parliament, but inſtruments, and glad at theſe Diſtempers, whereout they ſuck no ſmall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and certain Enemies, when time ſhall diſcover them, to the peace of the Church and State.</p>
            <p>The Quarrel would end the ſooner, if all men who partake therein would deliberately and ſeriouſly examine within themſelves, on what grounds, and for what reſpects they have wiſhed beſt to the one or to the other ſide, and if they have in a haſty and precipitate way erred in point of judgement, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract their Errors: the two known premiſes of [<note n="*" place="margin">Secunde cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationes ſunt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picutores.</note>

            <p>The <hi>Series</hi> of the War declared, the partakers known, who have been the Authors, what the Cauſe of this Contention; the Parliament by the event of what hath happened have been traduced and cenſured, the Authors the occaſion.</p>
            <p>The proper cauſe is <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> by whom committed follows, if <hi>Juſtice exalts a Nation,</hi> by the rule of Contraries, Injuſtice muſt overthrow it: Tis true, this calamity, theſe preſſures, theſe diviſions and Schiſms have happened in the time of the Parliaments ſitting, yet that Court no more the Cauſe thereof, then <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar's</hi> Raign the cauſe of Chriſts birth; He was born in the time of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> Raign; This Calamity befel in the time of the Parliaments ſitting: If the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament any cauſe at all, it is a very remote and leaſt principal, not to be reckoned poſitively a cauſe.</p>
            <p>No man can reaſonably think them to be the cauſe, that when as Diſcord doth waſte and rend the ſtrength which they have gained by Policy and friends, they will endanger the loſſe thereof by the weakneſſe of Diſſention.</p>
            <p>In a ſerious and Chriſtian apprehenſion of theſe Calamities, the ſupreme and original cauſe is our National Iniquities, <hi>Pride, Falſhood, Luxury, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods Word and His Laws, and the like,</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Anger of a juſt God; but that His o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:113760:43"/> attributes of mercy, <hi>which is over all His works, His long-ſuffering, and plenteousneſſe in Goodneſſe,</hi> can cancel and ſuperſede that of His juſtice, if the fault be not ſupinely ours, when as (if the commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of His readineſſe to forgive be no Doctrine of preſumption to embolden ſinners) He often ſpares for His elect, for a few righteous Mens ſake, the reſt.</p>
            <p>In the rank of natural and lower cauſes, Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as even now ſpoken of in the ſubordinate Miniſters of juſtice, which grindes the face, and adds to the number of the poor, hath been the proper and certain cauſe, although the <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Jo: Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> on the life of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.</note> Hiſtorian ſtateth it plainly againſt a King Himſelf; <hi>to private men, ſaith he, it is ſufficient that they do no wrong, but a Prince muſt provide that none under Him do wrong, for by the winking at the vices of His Officers, He makes them His own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One other ſin of a latter date may be added to the number of the cauſes of the continuance of this War, for which God is juſtly angry and hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely threatned; the faint and perfunctory keeping of the Proteſtation and Covenant entred into; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of not keeping it at all in many of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: for whileſt in the cloſe of the Proteſtation we ſhall vow <hi>to endeavour by all honorable and juſt ways, &amp;c.</hi> In which words ſome meaſure of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity at leaſt is requiſite.</p>
            <p>

            <p>The next amongſt external cauſes, is the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and reſtleſſe power of Flatterers, making a Prince believe in the vaſtneſſe of His Power over and above all Laws, excuſing and making leſſe His faults then indeed they are, rendring withall His acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons exempt from Sin or Error.</p>
            <p>The ſeaſonable Accident which befel <hi>Antigonus</hi> King of <hi>SYRIA,</hi> ſetting forth the falſhood of His Paraſites, made him repent His Error; in the Event, Himſelf and His Kingdom happy; who Hunting in a Forreſt, and earneſtly purſuing His Chaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing benighted, loſt His Followers, and happening into a poor mans houſe to take His lodging, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of His Hoſt, <hi>What that Country, who and what maner of Governor the King of that Countrey was?</hi> The poor man anſwered at large, not knowing Him, nor ſparing to tell Him or any of His faults; for which round dealing, the King diſcovering Himſelf at His fellow-Hunters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p> That no whit appliable, This the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as being inevitable, becauſe by ſurprize it ſeizes and annoys the perſon flattered, and by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading him to what he is not, robs him of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of being what he ſhould.</p>
            <p>Other occaſions and incentives have been of this War, the angry maner of Impeaching, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile of demanding the ſix Members of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, together with the Proclamations ſince accuſing other Members of High <note place="margin">See what the Aſſembly at <hi>OXFORD</hi> acknowledges, <hi>The Priviledge of Parliament to be ſo ſubſtantial and entire a Right, that the Invaſion, of the Liberties of either Houſe is an injury to the other, and to the whole Kingdom,</hi> in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration printed there, <hi>p.</hi> 12.</note> Treaſon, hath added to the fuel of this War; On what the Impeachment was firſt grounded, otherwiſe then as general Articles, is known to few, unleſſe it were for ſome ſuppoſed ill committed in their activeneſſe to perform what they thought their duty did enjoyn.</p>
            <p>In every deſign and purpoſe, there will be ſome more Activity in one, two, or more, then in the reſt, otherwiſe the purpoſe in hand is likely to ſtand ſtill: Every compleated Act is firſt the conception of ſome one individual perſon, then the conſent of the reſt: If the firſt beginners ſhall for their forwardneſſe (of no advantage to themſelves) be therefore accuſed of Crimes, and in a violent way purſued, it could not but ſtrike at the Root of the Subjects Liberty invaded lately, then in agitation to be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ſequel prove dangerous, the infringing the Power and Priviledge of Parliament, which ſo many Thouſands have proteſted to maintain.</p>
            <p>The Quarrel was as the Diviſion, great, and 'tis probable there would not have wanted witneſſes on
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:113760:44"/> the one party, as to prove the Articles, ſo to have aggravated the guilt of them to the higheſt againſt the other.</p>
            <p>The examination of which Articles, whether the ſix Members were guilty in matter of Fact of what they were accuſed; or whether the Articles were Treaſon in caſe they were guilty, is not proper to this Diſcourſe: The beginning and maner of the firſt entring into this War being ſet down, the Reader is left to judge, on which the Offenſive, on which the Defenſive is.</p>
            <p>If it were as certain that the Parliament did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this War intend any thing againſt the Honor of the King, as it is certain the Subjects Right and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty were encroached upon (to ſay no more of what is vehemently preſumed againſt the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) no queſtion then but the War muſt be thought Defenſive on the Kings part: But when theſe three endangered, the Incendiaries contriving the ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſame, conſequently the promoters of this War are judicially required to anſwer their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors, when as they ſhall by a ſtrong hand be reſcued from the hand of Juſtice, and in ſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Miſdemeanors of as high a nature retorted on their Judges (the Court of Parliament) Nothing but a War could decide the Controverſie, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial underſtanding diſcern between the Offenſive and Defenſive part.</p>
            <p>The Contention grew at firſt in point of Truſt, who ſhould be rather believed for what is promiſed, the King, rather thoſe about Him whom the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuſpected, or the Parliament it ſelf.</p>
            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:113760:45"/>
            <p> The ſeveral Reaſons for requiring Truſt, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to every mans view who hath obſerved their ſeveral Actions: The Parliament may plead their undertakings cannot be made good, nor the Truſt committed to them diſcharged in that free and juſt way as they would, becauſe themſelves oppoſed: A Court of Judicature confronted, and by an advers and equal power interrupted in their courſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, muſt needs abate in their power and efficacy: They have enough to do to detect and defeat the Fraud and Circumventions hourly practiſed againſt their place and perſon; their condition like to the cloſely beſieged in a Town of Gariſon, who to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and maintain themſelves, do many things againſt their natural, juſt and wonted courſe.</p>
            <p>Friends may be ſometimes oppreſſed and injured, Enemies favored; Juſtice cannot in perplexed times of danger be dealt with an exact and even poiſed hand, the Sword hanging ready to fall (like that of <hi>Damocles)</hi> on each mans head: A cunning Craftſman in diſſembling, and ſecret Enemy to that Court, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily engaged to ſupplant the ſame, may in his very demanding Juſtice, and expecting by reaſon of the greatneſſe of his place to be hearkned unto, preſſing withal their ſedulous liſtening to his Complaints, do it on purpoſe to divert their thoughts from their care of ſafety; a ſmall matter in equality of ſtrength, and in a doubtful Conflict, helpeth to ſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>Many are the exceptions againſt their Actions; This a certain one, the greateſt and moſt inevitable inconvenience in their proceedings Martial and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:113760:45"/> that ſome injury muſt be done, the very Act of War preſumes as much; and it is not their fault, it may be their unhappineſſe to be ſerved by ill Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Inſtruments will expect alſo to be winked at, in that they run the hazard of being cenſured to be Rebels for their ſakes who do imploy them; if not a little winked at, there is danger in theſe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and doubtful times of turning to the advers part, ſo the Subject is deſtined as it were to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; <hi>And marvel not,</hi> ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>if thou ſeeſt oppreſsion of the poor, or a violent perverting of Juſtice in a Province, and it muſt be that offences come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Miſcarriages, Violence and Inſolencies done by a few or many particular men, are not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to that Power which Governs them, unleſſe done by the Authority and Commiſſion of that Power.</p>
            <p>One other unfitneſſe may appear in the proceedings of the Parliament, as inevitable as the reſt, namely, in that they have in a ſubordinate way deputed men of a lower rank to execute their Commiſſions and other Acts in ſeveral Counties for raiſing money, &amp;c. or otherwiſe for diſcharging ſome Truſt to them committed; when as themſelves the more eminent, the more aimed at by the Enemy, and the nearer to danger, cannot appear with ſafety to execute the ſame: Let any man ſuppoſe it to be his own caſe, then he will not blame them for abſenting themſelves, and ſubſtituting others in their room.</p>
            <p>Many are the objections in this kinde which beget
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:113760:46"/> Diſputes, many accuſations had againſt either part: What the Parliament findes and complains to be practiced in oppoſition to them by their Enemies, they obſerve moſt ſenſible preſumptions for, no one thing in bar to ſuch preſumptions, to make up one tittle of compenſation in lieu of the dangers which might happen, or to give any the leaſt ſatisfaction for removing the imminency of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The vulgar and common ſalve uſed by His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties party, of <hi>His paſsing bills ſince the Parliament began, for the relief and eaſe of His Subjects,</hi> as a pledge of His Princely goodneſſe, and care of His peoples welfare: His often and deep Proteſtations for the maintenance of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom; yet as matters now are, theſe Acts of His not compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatory to thoſe hoſtile Acts practiced by His party againſt His Parliament and people: Beſides, thoſe Acts of Parliament paſſed by His Majeſty, are in His and a new Parliaments power to retract or repeal them at pleaſure: For let it be granted that they were Acts of Parliament which His Majeſty hath thus paſſed, in that the Members of both Houſes at <hi>WESTMINSTER</hi> are by His party denied to be a Parliament, yet ſometimes called <hi>[a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment]</hi> ſometimes <hi>[Rebels]</hi> there is like to be little ſtability in what they have enacted, neither is that which is contingent and poſſible to be altered, to be adjudged compenſatory to what is certain and actual.</p>
            <p>The difference of times, that they were reputed a <hi>Parliament</hi> when thoſe Acts paſſed, but ſince repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Rebels;</hi> or the diſtinction into perſons, that ſome
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:113760:46"/> are reſerved to be a <hi>[Parliament]</hi> others <hi>[Rebels]</hi> will breed a greater confuſion, then help to frame an Anſwer by thoſe of His Majeſties party, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject this favour of His Majeſties paſſing divers Bills for the welfare of His Subjects, &amp;c. That they may be repealed, altered in part or all, diſſolved, or want their vigour in execution, it is probable when the perſons who have and are the chief aſſiſtants in this War, are the greateſt Loſers by thoſe Acts recited.</p>
            <p>Next, as touching His Proteſtations, His fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Declarations of manifeſting His intentions, His late actions of Clemency and Pardon ſhewed to thoſe whom he calls <hi>[Rebels]</hi> when they were taken priſoners at a late Seige by His Majeſty, His releaſing and ſetting them free, when He might have detained and proceeded againſt them as Traytors and Rebels in the judgement of His party.</p>
            <p>Theſe are to be acknowledged indulgent and merciful Acts becoming a juſt and Chriſtian Prince; yet they may be two wayes underſtood, Firſt, in relation to the good of His own party, priſoners in the Parliaments power, and in danger to have ſuffered the like, in caſe the King ſhould have puniſhed theirs. Secondly, thoſe His Acts of releaſing, of His milde uſing of thoſe His priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, it is poſſible might be conſtrued as preſent Acts of Clemency, to endure only for a time, and that He may be perſwaded afterwards to puniſh them as Rebels: Theſe are times of wit and jealouſie, and the ſame Reaſons which have occſioned this War,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:113760:47"/> even His peoples Jealouſies, may continue them without abatement; there is no leſſe cauſe of fears and dangers, His party having tried every way, by traducing the Parliament at home, by attempting to ſet them at varience with Forraigners abroad, having moved every ſtone (as the Proverb is) to ſubdue thoſe whom they term Rebels, no way left untried to take away their power and ſhadow of power, no means left unaſſayed, either milde of Inviting, or violent in Affrighting, and thoſe plauſible and gratious Acts uſed, poſſibly to encreaſe yet the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his party, may ceaſe from a total pardoning, only remitting for a time, until a full Conqueſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: And when the Crown is repoſſeſt, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt fully had, the French Proverb tells us, <hi>Que la Coronne unifois prinſe oſte toute ſorte de defaults, i. e.</hi> that when the King ſhall be reinveſted to His for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer full Power and Regal Dignity, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the power thereof then laid aſide and become void; the poſſeſſing of the Crown doth as well quit all quarrels and acceptions, and cancels all diſputes, as it clears and purifies all manner of defaults, imperfections or exceptions to be made concerning the means, whether fair or foul of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>As Jealouſies have been the cauſe of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, ſo what the cauſe of Jealouſies? The principal and moſt certain one hath been in matter of fact, namely, the infringing the Subjects Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſoon after the Petition of Right was granted in full Parliament, to be omitted here, becauſe ſet forth in ſeveral Declarations and Remonſtrances.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:113760:47"/> One, and more univerſal, was that in the caſe of Ship-money, which had it not been withſtood by a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of repute (let his Ghoſt be railed at) and a Parliament ſoon after ſummoned, what had become of the Subjects Liberty? If a Writ comes down directed to a Sheriff of a County, he bound by Oath, or fearful of incurring diſpleaſure, in caſe he refuſe to execute the Kings Writ, and having the <hi>Poſſe Comitatus</hi> within his Office, what remedy ſhall the poor Countrey man have, dwelling one hundred, or two hundred miles from the Court, if he refuſe, or hath it not to pay, againſt Impriſonment, or his Goods taken from him by Diſtreſſe: Juſtice hath its boundary, and is circumſcribed by Law: Injury and Injuſtice, like the violent Torrent of an Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over-flowing the Banks and Metes, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelms and drowns; as Decency and Order when bound up by good and wholſom Laws, if diſturbed and broken down, falls into Uncertainty, Indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and becomes Confuſed: Let men talk of fears and jealouſies, and in an Ironical way ſmile at thoſe whoſe peculiar care is to prevent and remove the ſame; no man knows what the Progreſſe of that wrong had been, had it not been withſtood.</p>
            <p>The mention whereof ſeeing ſo often inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in other Writings, can be no pleaſing Theme to any Subject; And whereas His Majeſty hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and retracted that His Error, being now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to an utter abolition, ought to be buried in Oblivion; neither doth it become every ordinary Subject to traduce and accuſe His Soveraign of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice doing; it comes too near (to what the wiſe man
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:113760:48"/> expreſly forbids) of <hi>Curſing the King in their thoughts,</hi> as of what the Statute Law provides againſt.</p>
            <p>Only to ſatisfie one Objection uſed by ſome of His Majeſties party in His behalf touching the ſame, <hi>Better</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the payment thereof ſhould have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, then ſo much blood ſpilt, ſuch vaſt Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſpent in the maintenance of this War, and the Subject thus impoveriſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament grants as much, that of two evils the leſſer is to be choſen, where of neceſſity one muſt happen, as in caſe of inevitable neceſſity, that Wiſdom and Induſtry cannot prevent; if otherwiſe <hi>Neceſsitas non excuſat quae potuit eſſe non neceſsitas,</hi> ſaith a learned <note n="*" place="margin">Tertullian.</note> Father of the Church acutely: When the Princes Treaſure and Revenue ſuffice not for the Common good, as when the Realm is invaded, or any notable Rebellion of the Subjects happeneth, ſuch an Invaſion or Rebellion as is not <hi>procurata</hi> not <hi>ſimulata,</hi> but <hi>vera gravis &amp; manens,</hi> He may then by the common opinion of the <hi>Civilians</hi> impoſe new Taxes in requiring Aid, although out of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary and common way.</p>
            <p>The like Objection is made by others of His par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Better it were that thoſe ſix Gentlemen Impeached of High Treaſon ſhould have ſuffered, their Eſtates and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries overthrown and ruined, then to have a Kingdom waſted, other of His Majeſties Dominions deſtroyed, and ſo many thouſands worryed in one anothers blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſurely the rich mans Argument, who by reaſon of the ſuperfluity and plenty of his Eſtate, can eaſily bear the Charge, and is ſcarce ſenſible of the Burthen, or that he having a Power and Intereſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:113760:48"/> in his Neighbors Aſſeſſing him, is under-rated, and therefore content to pay the Tax, not ſticking at the Illegality of the ſame, he thinks <hi>his Hill ſo ſure that he ſhall never be removed,</hi> or his Power ſo great, that the Laws enacted for the relief of the poor, the number of which muſt needs multiply by reaſon of ſuch oppreſſions, will ſcarce concern the rich ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proverb of <hi>Neque accipitri, nec milvo tenditur rete.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One and the ſame Anſwer ſerves both Objections: It were better that a man ſhould receive a wound from a ſtronger then himſelf, and afterwards to be maimed by him a third or fourth time, after to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the like or greater Injury; better all this befal him, then to be killed (for ſo it happens to him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in his own defence) it had been better for him to have endured all thoſe Affronts and wounds, then by repulſing them to loſe his life, as the leſſe of the two Evils; but where the one might have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, no neceſſity of the other to have happened, the Objection is invalid.</p>
            <p>But to the ſubject of this Contention, multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf into ſeveral forms of Difference, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion hath for the moſt part been about matter of Fact.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What hath been done, what hath been attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted in offence to the Subjects Liberty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Touching the Object and Latitude of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, what Obedience, and whether all maner of Obedience is due unto the Kings Perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, for the Subject to perform whatſoever He requires.</p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:113760:49"/>
            <p> To the object of Obedience it is a commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Poſition, <hi>That the King is to be obeyed in all things Lawful and Honeſt,</hi> as before.</p>
            <p>The Propoſition is proved by the duty of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the higher Powers, in the firſt Verſe of the Chapter, the limitation ſhadoweth forth by the duty alſo of thoſe Powers <hi>to take vengeance on the Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers;</hi> for as <hi>Tremelius</hi> notes on that place, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful <note place="margin">See the Gloſſe.</note> things be commanded us, we muſt Anſwer as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> doth, <hi>It is better to obey God then man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto which, the queſtion touching the Latitude of Obedience hath a reference; for as for thoſe who exact and contend for a greater degree of Obedience, as to have all maner of Obeying, both Active and Paſſive due unto the Kings perſonal Commands; doubtleſſe all of them have not always thought it ſo, but enforce ſuch Doctrine now in theſe Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, on purpoſe to make the Kings party the ſtronger by their ſtrength of Arguing: If the King hath power of Life and Death, as to take His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects life in caſe he obeys Him not in whatſoever he Commandeth; then <hi>Nature, Neceſsity and Law</hi> (which allow, yea enjoyn proviſionary Acts for ſafety, and have endued Mankinde with ſeveral habiliments for its own defence) ſeem all to have loſt their ſtrength: Beſides, whether in ſuch a caſe as this here recited of the Kings power of Life and Death, if he take away a Subjects life, whether he be not guilty of the breach of the ſixth Commandment, I leave to an humble and moderate Divine to judge.</p>
            <p>To free the queſtion touching the extent of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Obedience, and cloſe it up with this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:113760:49"/> The Exactors of this unbounded and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence obedience ſeem to allow unto Kings a greater Latitude and Priviledge of Power, thence, a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Obedience from their Subjects unto them, then unto God; Hence is the Inference proved by this <hi>Enthymeme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That power is greateſt which requires the greater extent of Duty; wherefore if God neither can nor will command any thing unjuſt, and Kings may both (that is, they both can and have commanded unjuſt things) If notwithſtanding they be to be obeyed both <hi>Actively</hi> and <hi>Paſsively</hi> in whatſoever they do or will command, whether juſt or unjuſt, there is by conſequence a more Univerſal Obedience due unto them then unto God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third queſtion ſeems to be, whether the Court of Parliament <hi>being a Fundamental power, and all Fundamentals equall, all principals alike, having proteſted the maintenance of the Kings Honor, Perſon and Eſtate, may in defence of the King, Laws and Government, when imminently endangered, eſpecially when actually invaded, juſtifie to take up Arms, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and againſt the Kings Perſonal command, if He refuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether dangers are imminent, is briefly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
            <p>The Kings party deny the imminency of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they ſay they are but <hi>Phantaſms and unneceſſary fears &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When miſchief is neer and threatens, opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and power ſerving withal, it may be termed danger, when 'tis already fallen, 'tis part the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:113760:50"/> name of danger, and becomes Calamity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The final and caſting reſult of the States judgement, what thoſe Laws, dangers, and means of preſervation are, reſide in the two Houſes of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The two Houſes of Parliament, are alwayes a part in the ſupremacy of power, and in caſe of the others ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerce or refuſal, as matters now ſtand, Both virtually the whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>In the final reſolution of the judgement of the State, the people are to reſt, and in obedience thereunto, may in defence of the Laws and Government uſe and bear Arms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that the Parliaments Votes and Ordinances are in themſelves infallible, but to us inevitable; nor <hi>do we Idolize them,</hi> or Doctor <hi>Fern</hi> infers, nor think <hi>them omnipotent, as His Majeſty or ſome of His party do hyperbolically and ſmilingly object:</hi> Not to poſſeſs the Reader with the Dignity &amp; Priviledge of that Court, by tranſcribing here any ancient or particular paſſages of conteſt, which are not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable to juſtifie the Authority therof, when as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars prove not generality in Arguings, ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars eſpecially as are eaſily anſwered; yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Hiſtorian notes it as an evidence of the Earls courage, or of the Parliaments power, the paſſage is ſhort, and not unfitly quoted of the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> his conteſt with King <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. who directing his Privy-Seal for diſcharging the Earl of his Captain-ſhip of <hi>CALLIS,</hi> the Earl re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing continued his office, his reaſon was, <hi>that it was granted him by a Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereto it may be objected, <hi>that might be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:113760:50"/> 
               <hi>contumacy in the Earl,</hi> which proves not the Authority of that Court, therefore not binding other Subjects; yet this objection may be replyed unto, that the Earl knew on what ground, and by what judgement his refuſing it was granted.</p>
            <p>The Court of Parliament is not hereby ſo adored or prized, nor are they ſo fond of their own Acts and Ordinances, as to think them abſolutely pure and unchangeably perfect, or to derive the bleſſing of ſucceſſe on their deſigns, for the merit of their actions, inuring for the preſent, either in abrogating ancient or conſtituting new Acts and Ordinances, which they may retract as occaſion ſhall ſerve, but to the Juſtice of their endeavourings, which were they able to make good their proper and total power, they would ere this have termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and reduced their Acts into eſtabliſhed Laws: It is probable that many of thoſe ancient uſuages and Conſtitutions, which they for reaſons beſt known to themſelves have for the preſent altered, will revert and turn them to their former being, without utterly abrogating the ſame.</p>
            <p>To conclude and ſettle the doubtful and wavering Judgements had, touching the power and Authority of this Court, the aforecited <note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>Ed. Cook.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Oracle</hi> of Law, hath delivered at large in his fourth Book of <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> who wrote it in a calm and quiet time, when there was no need to defend the Authority thereof.</p>

               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:113760:51"/> 
               <hi>Grievances, and remedy of Miſchiefs in a Common-wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The three firſt Concluſions are evident by what hath been obſerved before; the latter of the three is Diſcourſed at large by a learned Author in his Book Intituled, <hi>A more full Anſwer to Doctor</hi> Fern.</p>
            <p>But to anſwer one objection, concerning the taking up of Arms, and <hi>that the People take up Arms againſt their King, which the objectors ſay, is unlawful under what pretence ſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Queſtion be rightly weighed and ſtated, it will evidently appear, that this is no taking up Arms againſt the King, no more then a Chyrurgion doth offend or wrong his Patient, when to recover and preſerve the whole body, he cuts and takes away the proud and putrified fleſh, encircling and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the more eminent and ſounder part: And if in this Quarrel the King ſhall unneceſſarily and with hazard to himſelf againſt the advice, ſupplication and importunity of His Subjects, expoſe Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to danger, Gods protection (being more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſeen over his Anointed) is herein croſſed, if not tempted; and if it happen otherwiſe to Him then His Subjects would, His miſcarrying is of Himſelf, or rather from thoſe who perſwade Him to it.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion which hath coſt this blood, is not now betwixt a King governing according to the ſtrict and preciſe Rules of Law (the meaſure of each mans Right) and Subjects rebelliouſly riſing up in arms againſt their King and thoſe Laws, as ſome men in their gall of bitternes have given out; but betwixt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:113760:51"/> a King tranſgreſſing the known Laws (as Himſelf confeſſeth and retracts His Fault) and a Court of Parliament, the Supreme Councel of the Kingdom, endeavoring in a juſt and legal way to puniſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Offendors as former Parliaments have done, no other power or force to diſpute or emulate a King's; and the matter whereon they quarrel, an actual invaſion made on the Fundamental Laws, and a party engaged to imbrace and abet the ſame, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under the notion of Loyalty, or from Humor, Ambition and Levity on the one ſide, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament with a party adhering unto them, contending to preſerve thoſe Laws, with the Subjects Right and Liberty on the other ſide: For, the controverſie is not immediately and principally in the new-ſprung Differences about Church or State-Government, as which the more perfect Form in State, <hi>Monarchical, Oligarchical,</hi> or <hi>Ariſtocratical;</hi> which in Church-Government, an <hi>Independent, Presbyterial</hi> or <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal;</hi> which latter two are not much differing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Primitive Inſtitution, as anon will be ſhewed in its proper place: (All theſe Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies are emergent only, and reſulting out of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this War, which gives occaſion and liberty to all diſſentions, and makes every one a fierce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batant in maintenance of his own opinion:) But the principal parties are, as before obſerved, a party who hath actually violated the Laws by which we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, and have their partakers; and a party who contend and would preſerve the ſame: The firſt abetted under the ſtile of being good Subjects, the latter traduced and inveighed againſt as <hi>Rebels.</hi>

            <p> What the <hi>Laws</hi> of this Kingdom, conveyed unto us in theſe latter times are, under which we are born and governed, is by an ordinary light of ſtudy ſo figured in all mens knowledge, as no man can but conſent unto and confeſſe, <hi>That to be the Law which the Court of Parliament doth Enact,</hi> (which Court hath power alſo to <hi>Repeal, Diſſolve, Alter,</hi> or make <hi>Perpetual</hi> as they pleaſe) and that to be a Parliament certainly and definitively, which is the aſſembling together of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> of this Kingdom, lawfully ſummoned by the King in the prudent and deliberate Counſel of his heart, at ſuch a <hi>Time,</hi> to ſuch a <hi>Place,</hi> for Reaſons expreſſed in that His <hi>Writ.</hi>

            <p>Beſides, obſerve the difference of Times and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which ſatisfies the Queſtion: Former Kings have been willing to call often Parliaments, that the Uſage and Neceſſity of often Summoning grew <note place="margin">36. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</note> into a Law, and yet in force, to call one every year; when in this of His Majeſties Raign, how ſeldom and ſparingly He hath called any.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:113760:53"/> from the ſeveral parts of the Kingdom, they ſhould not upon every light matter of Debate be diſſolved and remitted home, His Majeſty was pleaſed to paſſe an Act againſt Diſſolving without their own conſent; how ſoon after their ſitting and that Act paſſed, their Priviledges were ſeized, by charging ſeveral Members of either Houſe of High Treaſon.</p>
            <p>Which when that could not take effect, nor their perſons ſeized, the King withdraws Himſelf (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed thereto) from the Parliament and their place of ſitting, thereby to make void their Court, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of His Majeſty one part, yet His perſonal preſence in this caſe not ſo requiſite, as that His abſence ſhould make void the Parliament.</p>

            <p>The King and His party at <hi>OXFORD</hi> do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it truly; Again, He or His parties inſtability of Actions, do ſeem to renew the doubt, certainly do wound their own Cauſe: For whileſt His Majeſty often and of late calls the Aſſembly at <hi>WEST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINSTER [The Parliament]</hi> and the Aſſembly at <hi>OXFORD</hi> by one and the <note place="margin">The Aſſembly at <hi>OX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORD</hi> acknowledge in their Declaration printed there, March 1643. <hi>The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at</hi> WESTMIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STER <hi>not to be Diſſolved,</hi> pag. 25.</note> ſame ſtile, and that two Parliaments are inconſiſtent at one and the ſame time in this Kingdom, the people unleſſe wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perverſly ignorant, are not to ſeek which is the proper Parliament.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:113760:55"/> haply will not admit delay or a ſecond meeting, but may require their ſitting up till ten, eleven, or twelve a clock in the night, and may again their meeting at ſix, five, or four, or ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the morning; If they pleaſe to abate ſo much of their own repoſe and reſt, by their pains and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, their Countrey is ſo much the more behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; <hi>many of the Countries have in their</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The reaſon of the <hi>ſmall number at</hi> WEST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINSTER, <hi>wherewith the Aſſembly at</hi> OX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORD <hi>chargeth them,</hi> is obvious to each mans underſtanding; They make them thin, and then upbraid them with their thinneſſe: Tis as if Friends and Companions in a Journey ſhall ſee their fellow Travellers in danger to be robbed, and ride away without aſſiſting them in danger, whoſe fault is it in caſe they are robbed, the failing of thoſe who might have helped, or the paucity of thoſe who are robbed? this in reſpect of the other is a remote, leaſt principal and accidental cauſe.</p>
            <p>Tis eaſie for a Prince to confer Honors upon men, ſo to fill the Houſe of Peers, divers wayes alſo to increaſe the number in the Houſe of Commons to His party; but for the one party to make the other thin, and then to undervalue the power of them becoming ſo, is like one impoveriſhing another by forſaking him in thoſe duties of friendſhip which he owes, and then contemning him.</p>
            <p>The next odds obſerved by the Aſſembly at <hi>OXFORD,</hi> between the Parliament at <hi>WEST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINSTER</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:113760:55"/> and themſelves, <hi>is the Kings preſence with them at</hi> OXFORD, <hi>and a major part of the Lords,</hi> therefore out-weighing the Dignity of thoſe at <hi>WESTMINSTER.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which exception, as to the Kings being there, is anſwered <hi>by the Law of not Diſſolving,</hi> or by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties being <hi>Virtually,</hi> although not <hi>Perſonally</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>In that the greater part of the Nobility are with the King, His party therefore the more Honored, 'tis anſwered without Diſputing the Dignity or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of either part, as which the more valuable in Birth or Breeding, thoſe which went away, or thoſe which ſtaid behinde; Compariſons are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly, and forbid what this Diſcourſe doth aim at <hi>[Reconcilement, Union.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was not ſo at the firſt entrance into this Quarrel, the King withdrawing Himſelf from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, many of the Peers thought themſelves by duty of their place obliged to attend on His Majeſty, and might have power (it is like) to prevail with ſome other of their fellow-Peers: Beſides, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility are to be conſidered as in the next Claſſe and Attendant on His Majeſty, ſome by their place, others more remotely Intereſted; wherefore ſeeing Safety and Preferment are the Stake which moſt men of all ſorts contend for (let the World be made believe it is Conſcience, Loyalty) the King the Fountain of Honor, in whom to <hi>Reward</hi> and <hi>Pardon;</hi> they who are neareſt Him hope firſt to gain by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying themſelves to ſerve and pleaſe Him.</p>

               <hi>nor ſervice to the Court,</hi> which was only in thoſe days true, when a juſt and uninterrupted Peace did flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, no man but could perceive through the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this Diſcord, that <hi>Peace, Plenty,</hi> and <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> in <hi>Rewarding</hi> would all be loſt in a Civil De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive War.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion was at the firſt much controverted, which the more juſt or rightful Cauſe, the Kings, or the Parliaments divided from the King? Many of the Grandees adhering to the Court, and more Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in an implicite faith, adhered to the Kings; no more marvel, then that Servants immediatly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant on their Maſter, ſhould venture their obedience and aſſent unto him becauſe their Maſter, without examining the Reaſon of ſo aſſenting, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, purſue their undertakings, or be meanly thought of in caſe they ſhall renounce the ſame, the credit whereof is diſcerned in the quality of the Cauſe undertaken, not in the reſolvedneſſe of the Servant undertaking it.</p>
            <p>Princes can and often do reward their Friends and Favorites; the Parliament cannot or ſeldom doth, it is beſides their uſual courſe to give, beſides their Friends expectance to receive other Salary then the redemption of their juſt Liberties, for which they fight, the maintenance of their ancient Birth-right, conveyed unto them by the known Laws, ſaving in ſome few particular caſes, where the Parliament ſhall meet with a deſperately engaged and reſtleſſe Enemy of great Power and Eſtate to fight and foment the Quarrel againſt; on the other ſide, ſome Friends Eminent in Deſert, of ſmaller Fortunes to fight for
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:113760:56"/> them; In ſuch a caſe, to diſſeize their Enemy, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh his power, to inveſt and gratifie their Friend to augment his Fortune, ſeems not unjuſt, nor unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. But to return.</p>
            <p>The diſtinction of <hi>Virtual</hi> and <hi>Perſonal</hi> ſeems of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, yea the Declaration calls it <hi>Trayterous,</hi> which no indifferent man will judge, until Victory (by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inſolent) makes every thing diſpleaſing to the Conqueror, <hi>Criminal:</hi> As when thoſe on the Kings ſide hoped to have over-run and conquered all, no man wiſhing well to the Parliament, durſt name them joyntly; whereas ſimply and univocally to hold for King and Parliament is the ſureſt and moſt Loyal tenure: Howbeit nothing can be with more anger and diſpleaſingly received by the more perverſe and inſolent amongſt His Majeſties party, then for them to hear thoſe on the Parliaments ſide ſay that <hi>[They are for the King and Parliament]</hi> So the Quarrel hath ſeveral overtures of increaſing, the Parliament party taking it indignly at the Kings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's hands to be thought Diſloyal, Falſe, Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, as the King's expreſſe their anger with the Parliaments, for ſaying <hi>[They are for King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To believe or ſay that the King is ſeduced by evil Councel, is in their heat and anger <hi>a wounding His Majeſty through His Councels ſides,</hi> which exception of theirs muſt render Him infallible in judgement, or ſo ſingular in wiſdom, as to be above, or to ſtand in no need of Councel (for if he makes uſe of Councel, and erres by their Advice, the Error is His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels) or muſt preſume in Him ſuch tranſcendency of

            <p>They have deſerted their fellow-Members in

            <p>To correct and ſweeten the Malady thereof, ſomething muſt be publiſhed, nothing more acceptable then the name of Peace, but on what terms more then the name of peace in a general word, they do not declare: A condiſcending muſt be had as well as a meeting for peace, &amp; thoſe ought to condiſcend who are the moſt certain &amp; firſt Tranſgreſſors.</p>
            <p>In the Act of offering a Treaty for <hi>Peace,</hi> to invent new charges of <hi>high Treaſon, of capital Miſdemeanors, of Injuſtice,</hi> is no right way to <hi>Peace,</hi> unleſſe the perſons charged are guilty of the ſame, as namely, they charge the Parliament or their Committees, to <hi>have impriſoned two Lords for their Loyalty to the King,</hi> as if their Loyalty were the unqueſtionable and certain cauſe of their Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>Theſe Lords might happily ſhew themſelves active againſt and diſobedient to the Parliaments Authority (for in theſe unſetled and diſtracted times, few men do, others will not know their proper duty) and ſo come within the compaſſe of ſome

            <p>The Parliament think themſelves not guilty of that Crime by the Verdict of moſt men, nor every thing made to the Mould by which it is made, is not ſimply <hi>Counterfeiting;</hi> the quality of the offence is much diſcerned in the maner of the offending, and every Law-making commonly relates to ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terite fraud and wickedneſſe: Now whether a King and a Parliament ſince the firſt conſtitution of either, have heretofore made uſe of the Great Seal to croſſe one anothers Acts, be to be found in any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord whereon to ground a Law, the Reader is to ſeek.</p>

            <p>Which are greater numbers of them on the one ſide or the other, or which the more able Lawyers is not here determined: But to the Objection (if any ſuch) <hi>That a greater number of them are within the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Parliament, in</hi> LONDON <hi>and other places elſwhere,</hi> wherefore they may ſeem rather to ſide with that power.

            <p>One of the learnedſt of that Tribe in thoſe days wherein he lived, and much Honored for his parts and induſtry, wrote a whole Tractate for the

            <p>In the ſame Declaration full of ſuſpition, and fraught with quarrelling, the Aſſembly at <hi>OX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORD</hi> except againſt the words of a Meſſage ſent from the Lords and Commons to His Majeſty, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſame year, March 1643. <hi>viz.

            <p>The words admit a two-fold ſenſe, the one, of the Parliaments meaning (as the Aſſembly at <hi>OX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORD</hi> ſeem to conſtrue it) the other more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of their lamenting and foreſeeing in their ſadneſſe and grief of heart, the inevitable and univerſal ruine which muſt attend this War.</p>
            <p>For that, <hi>His Majeſty cannot be the leaſt Sufferer,</hi> 'tis too probable; whoſe ſufferings can be compared to His? in the deſtruction of many thouſands of His people, as well in the greateſt and deareſt to Him, as in the meaner ſort, <hi>in all whom conſists His Safety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This exception, above the reſt, was in theſe ſad and ſuſpitious times, unſeaſonably moved by His

            </p>
            <p>Nor <hi>to be the laſt,</hi> no man can think His Majeſty will ſurvive the loſſe of all His people; a good Subjects Prayer ought to be, with a ſmall inſertion in the Poets addreſſe to his <hi>Maecenas, Serus in caelum redeat, &amp;c. ſerus é terra,</hi> then <hi>in caelum redeat diu<expan>

            <p>For Rhetorique and ſtrength of Wit, or for a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate and fine ſtile of Expreſſion, the Aſſembly at <hi>OXFORD,</hi> as having the more youthful, facere and nimble Wits in their party and Quarters, the help and influence of the pregnant conceits, and nimble Fancies in the Univerſity there, may ſeem to have the ſtart: But let the Writings on both ſides be examined according to Reaſon and Judgement, and the Reader will judge the difference: Let it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in three or four the moſt remarkable Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Writing, and the Anſwers thereunto, no other being ſo oppoſite to each other as theſe here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

            <p>A Treaty hath been agreed upon, and PROPOSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS ſuited whereon to Treat, the one ſide real and ſincere to conclude a Peace, expoſed to the Publique view, nothing to be objected againſt the reality of their meaning: If on the other ſide there were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of fraud, and a pretence only of Peace, ſet forth to gain advantage by (as there be preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions to prove the ſame) the pretenders can anſwer for themſelves: All ways are honeſt, and fraud and falſhood are vertues in Adverſaries to Rebellion, contending to ſubdue and ſcatter Rebels: Peace is a pledge of Friendſhip, and Friendſhip hath no other terms of intercourſe then goodneſs, as that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſt <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>All which are matters of Form, accidental and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate concernment in reſpect of what the Parliament demands, neceſſary for the Publique good: namely,</p>

            <p>So the Contention, rather the miſtake grows about granting or refuſing theſe, betwixt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of which two demands, there cannot be ſo great a difference as betwixt natural humanity to ſpare from killing, and unnatural cruelty to perſiſt in killing, or ſo important, as that Peace and War ſhould depend thereupon, which if the demands on either ſide were granted by the other, might haply have determined into Peace.</p>
            <p>The reaſon for demanding on the one ſide, as for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing on the other are too tedious for this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>OXFORD</hi> Relator hath by a large Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, taken pains to ſatisfie the world, of the

Neither is there ſo great and material a Difference betwixt the two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided parts of the Parliament ſide <hi>[The Presbyterian and Independent]</hi> as for a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel to continue and depend upon: The wiſdom of that Court hath taken away the virulency of any quarrel which might happen betwixt them two, by conſtituting the one, yet with reſpect had to the tenderneſſe of Conſcience in the other; Although the one be fully declared for by the Lords and Commons in the Parliament in their ſolid and ſatisfactory Declaration this preſent <hi>April,</hi> yet with a due regard had to Tender conſciences not differing in Fundamentals of Religion, that they alſo may be provided for, &amp;c. wherefore it is rather Luxury, Pride of Wit, and contempt of Authority, then any object of a real difference which animates and maintains theſe quarrels.</note> Divine Worſhip, that which His Majeſty demands of <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Government, differs little from what the Parliament doth intend of <hi>Presbyterial, Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> in their primitive Inſtitution being all one.</p>
            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:113760:66"/>
            <p> In the Forms of Divine Worſhip, the Directory injoyned by the Parliament not really differing in the material parts thereof from the Common-Prayer-Book required by the King, onely the one expugning for the preſent, what the other doth contain; That being more painful to the Miniſter, not more declaring his Abilities; This the more eaſie as being dictated unto him: either may be of uſe, either behoofful to the Auditory, as meeting with all the neceſſities, and deprecating the contingency of all afflictions incident to man-kinde, the Common-Prayer-Book compiled by ſound and learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and accordingly ordained by an ancient Law, the Directory framed by the like learned men, and Ordained by a Modern Authority to be made uſe of for the preſent ſeaſon, or ſo long as Authority ſhall think good; But that which abates the value of this, is the weakneſſe of the Argument in the defender thereof, preferring it therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Common-Prayer, becauſe the uſe of the Directory ſets forth the gifts and Abilities of the Preacher beyond his reading or exerciſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer, which is digeſted already into a Form, when as that rather denotes the beſt Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and parts of Schollerſhip in point of Science, Study, Judgement, which is able to perform the hardeſt work, to diſpence Gods Myſteries aright, to ſet them forth in a hanſome and polite ſtile, the power of the ſpirit is no whit checked or blemiſhed by an eloquent expreſſion, to raiſe and apply ſound Doctrine, winning the Attention and edifying the hearer, is harder then to conceive and utter Prayer.</p>
            <pb n="128" facs="tcp:113760:67"/>
            <p> One other reaſon for uſing the Directory is, that ſeeing we and the Scots are United by a Solemn League and Brotherhood, and they not uſing the Lyturgy of our Church, we ſhould therefore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from uſing the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſw.</label> They and we are born and Governed under dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and diſtinct Laws, their Manners and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms differ much from ours; The Union betwixt the Nations will ſerve for ſupport &amp; aid of both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under one and the ſame Dominion in caſe of either infeſted by an enemy, but for the ſame numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Form of Divine Worſhip, to be performed after the ſelf ſame kinde, this Arguing ſeems rather an Illuſtration then a proof.</p>
            <p>God is an uncircumſcribed and incomprehenſible Spirit, to be Worſhipped in truth and ſpirit, he cares not whether by heart without book, or in a book opened, ſo he be Worſhipped with the heart.</p>
            <p>This onely by the way to ſhew as there is no identity of Form betwixt the Directory and Common-Prayer-Book, ſo no ſuch Diſcrepancy unleſſe in the perſons uſing them, as to heighten or continue theſe unnatural differences.</p>
            <p>The reaſons given by His Majeſties Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for making a Ceſſation betwixt Him and the Iriſh Rebels, and the Parliaments Commiſſioners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to have ſuch Ceſſation void, are of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er moment; the Kings urging it <hi>diſhonorable on His part to vacate the Ceſſation, wiſhing alſo that it were in</hi>

               <hi>His power to do it:</hi> But why diſhonorable, or how comes it to paſſe that it is out of His Majeſties Power to ſuppreſſe the Rebellion there, as his
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:113760:67"/> Commiſſioners urge? unleſſe by employing and making uſe of his ſtrength againſt this, he abates and leſſens it as againſt that Kingdom; His Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners their reaſons given for both are anſwered in what follows, and the judgement in deciding the Queſtion, to be given according to the late paſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences which the Declarations and Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces within theſe few years publiſhed have ſet forth.</p>
            <p>If His Majeſty did make the Ceſſation to the end to ſave the Remainder of His Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects there, it was an Honorable and Pious care in him towards thoſe his Subjects, but if from a more principal and ultimate end of making ſuch Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to make uſe of the contending parties in that Kingdom againſt his Subjects called Rebels in this, the Parliaments Commiſſioners had reaſon to preſſe the vacating of ſuch Ceſſation; They farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting thereon, that if the Ceſſation had not been made in the time of the Rebels their greateſt wants, and the Forces imployed then and there againſt them not drawn off, they might in probability have been ſubdued, and this War even finiſhed.</p>
            <p>They alſo urge that if the Cloaths going into <hi>IRELAND</hi> for the ſupply of the Proteſtants and Army there, had not been taken away by the Kings Souldiers near <hi>COVENTRY</hi> and within His Quarters, the Engliſh and Proteſtants there had been relieved, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That the goods and Cloaths ſo taken away, was not without His Majeſties knowledge and direction, unto which the Kings Commiſſioners reply, <hi>That thoſe Cloaths had not been taken away, if they had</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:113760:68"/> 
               <hi>had a Conduct to have more ſafely paſſed through the Countrey;</hi> and further urge, <hi>That thoſe Forces and other Proviſions intended for the Relief of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Subjects in that Kingdom, were diverted and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed againſt Him, namely in the Battel at</hi> EDGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HILL.</p>
            <p>For proof whereof they mention three or four witneſſes, ſome of whom engaged for the ſervice of the Parliament, and deſerting now the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement are advers, and none more extreme Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Parliament, whither they be compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent witneſſes in ſo extreme a Conflict to prove the Accuſations.</p>
            <p>If witneſſes may be admitted, known to be <note place="margin">☞</note> maliciouſly oppoſite to that party againſt which they are witneſſes, the inconvenience may prove in theſe looſe and deſperate times as generally noxious as the War it ſelf hath been.</p>
            <p>The Anſwer to ſuch Accuſation as the Kings Commiſſioners therein urge, is no where more fully to be had then to the Enquiry into the Original of this War; whereunto all Treaties had to compoſe this vaſt difference muſt have recourſe, otherwiſe a meeting to conclude a Peace, will vaniſh into Contention and Diſputes, for want of a certain Rule or conſtant Principle to guide the Treaters by.</p>
            <p>The well weighing of the Proteſtation lately taken, might have confined and ſetled the doubtful and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts of man, in what the end and aime of the Proteſtation was, a promiſe to fulfil in as much as in us lies, the Commandments of the firſt and ſecond Table of the Law, directing our duty towards
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:113760:68"/> God and man, the ſeveral parts in the Proteſtation tending in the ſum to the maintenance of <hi>Gods Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, the Kings, the Subjects Right and Liberty</hi> (no one part thereof if rightly underſtood and applied croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing another) and therefore how it comes to paſſe that the Proteſtation being one and the ſame, the courſe of mens affections ſhould be thus divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to partakings, or that ſome ſhould be of opinion, that to maintain the <hi>Kings Honor, Perſon and Eſtate,</hi> is to adhere unto Him in this preſent War in what He ſhall command: They ſhould withal conſider the other parts of the Proteſtation <hi>viz.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion, the Power and Priviledges of Parliament, the Subjects Right and Liberty;</hi> for by the Proteſters obſerving all, the King is beſt obſerved and trulleſt, His Honor and promiſes being ingaged to maintain the latter three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when as every one who takes the Proteſtation, doth thereby endeavor to make Him a Soveraign Lord of a free and flouriſhing people; The Kings Proteſtations concurring with and tending to that end, ſo the Proteſtation taken altogether is beſt obſerved and kept.</p>
            <p>To the Proteſtation <hi>for the defence of the Proteſtant Religion,</hi> every one who takes it, is not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly bound by vertue of his Vow, to extirpate or remove all Papiſts (that is above the power and liberty of every common perſon) but if he ſees the Proteſtant Religion in danger of declining, and that the Papiſt is connived at and countenanced by higher powers (for the queſtion is not about the certain and actual bringing in of Popery, but
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:113760:69"/> touching the cauſes of ſuſpition) if the Proteſter adhereth to that party which promiſeth to defend the Proteſtant, and oppoſeth that which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanceth the Popiſh, his Proteſtation is the trulieſt kept, a Promiſe or Vow the more purſued the more fulfilled.</p>
            <p>In like maner to the other part of the ſame Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, <hi>viz. The maintenance of the Kings Honor,</hi> every one who takes the ſame is not thereby bound to comply, aſſent unto and obey the King in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever He may command, whether unlawful or unjuſt, or to think all His attempts and actions Juſtifiable throughout: This were indeed in the higheſt degree to Honor Him; but in a more ſerious and as truly a loyal way of His being honored by His Subjects, is when they or thoſe who are put in place and authority over them, ſhall enquire into and provide againſt all things incident to His Diſhonor, when they ſhall endeavor to chaſtiſe and ſuppreſſe all Affronts and inſolencies which may be offered to His Honor; This although a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and leſſe flattering, yet a more ſtable and certain diſcharge of Duty in Honoring Him.</p>
            <p>But to proceed and examine wherefore His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 119.</note> Commiſſioners preſſe the <hi>want of a Conduct for the guard of thoſe Forces and other proviſions intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the relief of His Majeſties Subjects in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of IRELAND,</hi> &amp;c. it ſeems ſtrange, when as His giving way to many ſubſcribers and adventurers into that Kingdom, His often and tender expreſſions of the deplorable and ſad Eſtate of His Subjects there, His offering to go in Perſon for the better
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:113760:69"/> reducing the Rebels there (all or moſt of theſe being known to all His Subjects) was ſafety enough in all likelihood, and above the ſtrength of many Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Souldiers, or above the validity of any Commanders paſſe, to have ſecured the tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch Cloaths and other Proviſions intended thither from the violence of His own party.</p>
            <p>The Parliament Commiſſioners urge farther, That it was Declared from His Majeſty, That he did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve the ſubſcriptions of the Officers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, by means whereof that courſe was diverted: That the Commiſſioners ſent by the two Houſes of Parliament for the better ſupplying and encouraging the Army in that Kingdom, were diſcountenanced and commanded from the Councel there, where the proſecution of the War was to be managed, unto which no Anſwer or Excuſe is ſet down by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Relation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Majeſties Commiſsioners derive the good and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Ceſſation from the Lords Juſtices, and Councel of that Kingdom, intimating the ſame by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſent from thoſe Lords to His Majeſty and the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, and that had it not been for ſuch Ceſſation, the Proteſtants there could not have ſubſisted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament Commiſſioners anſwer, That <note place="margin">

            <p>The Arguing and Debating which, hindering the Supplies and Aſſiſtance which otherwiſe might have been afforded, hath added much to the Affliction and Calamity of His Proteſtant Subjects there, and to be imputed wholly to the Authors and Perſiſters in this War: For whileſt both parties in the War do contend to maintain and increaſe their power in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition each to other, and conſequently forbear to ſend Aid to the Proteſtants there, the ſmall number yet remaining of the Engliſh and Scotiſh cannot poſſibly ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>Who ſuch Authors and Cauſers of this War have been, is long ſince manifeſted and reſolved by the joynt advice and proviſion made againſt them in the Articles of the large Treaty betwixt the Kingdom of <hi>ENGLAND</hi> and <hi>SCOTLAND</hi> Auguſt, <note place="margin">

            <p>If it be <hi>diſhonorable to His Majeſty,</hi> as His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners urge, <hi>to make void that Ceſſation</hi> out of gratitude and favor to the Papiſts there affiſting Him in this War, His Commiſſioners, His Friends and His party might have ſpared to object thoſe Acts paſſed by His Majeſty this Parliament, in favor and caſe to His Subjects, when as if this Parliament be born down or diſſolved, the Acts paſſed by His Majeſty this Parliament are Repealable, Alterable in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:113760:70"/> part or in all by a ſucceeding Parliament, by which Acts already paſſed, many of His Friends and party adhering to Him againſt this Parliament, have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in their Eſtates, as is before expreſſed.</p>
            <p>For neither the ſuppreſſing of <hi>Star Chamber</hi> or <hi>High Commiſsion Court,</hi> the granting of a <hi>Triennial Parliament</hi> (which are inſtanced in as Acts of Grace, and the Subjects charged with Ingratitude for not valuing ſuch gracious Acts) are no infallible and conſtant notes of ſuch His Goodneſſe and Favor to His people, when as thoſe Acts are Repealable at pleaſure; nor that of the <hi>Triennial Parliament,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a Parliament be of force to maintain their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Priviledges, which this hath ſought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend for their own, and for ſucceeding Parliaments.</p>

               <hi>As for His Majesties Commiſsioners to urge, excuſing in their way the King and His party from violating the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Fundamental Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Parliament and their Committees are guilty of breaking the ſame, and they alone,</hi> as if no ſuch thing were done by His Majeſties party, Souldiers and Commiſſioners employed for raiſing Arms and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to proſecute this War.</p>
            <p>Such charge againſt the Parliament muſt either be underſtood of their aboliſhing for the preſent ſome ancient Conſtitutions, or of their compulſory wayes in raiſing Moneys for the maintenance of this War, the reaſon, the means of the one and the other is exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p>If his Commiſſioners underſtood it of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and late Robberies committed by the Souldiers on poor Countrymen and Travellers on the road,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:113760:71"/> that cannot be charged on the Parliament, becauſe it is done againſt their will, and to prevent the like, they have according to the Law brought the offendors to condign puniſhment, wherein alſo the Kings Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are the moſt offendors, when as the Parliament Souldiers are required for their Aſſiſtance to reſcue from the Robbery and Spoylings committed by the Kings, beſides it hath been obſerved that many wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wel to the Parliament, Travellers on the ways ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving met with Souldiers, and doubtful on which ſide they were, <hi>being demanded for whom they were,</hi> have counterfeited their tone, and anſwered <hi>For the King,</hi> as being aſſured that if thoſe Souldiers were fort he Parliament, they ſhould finde leſſe cruel uſage then by the Souldiers for the King.</p>
            <p>This, Experience hath throughly taught, and theſe and the like actions committed by His party, hath made His Majeſties name the more terrible.</p>
            <p>In that the like hoſtile and cruel Acts are practiſed on either part, and that the fear of cruelty working more ſtrongly on the common ſort, hath brought many of them to yeeld and comply with the more cruel part, the inequality of the cruelty hath been obſerved to be great between the one ſide, who to gain or ſave a Town, or for the like advantage ſake have burned or pulled down ſome houſes, in a ſudden and revengeful heat have killed and Enemy; and the other ſide, which in cool blood have killed and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred many hundred of inoffenſive Subjects, burned whole Towns, <hi>and laid waſte the dwelling places of the Poor and Fatherleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if the one ſide had waſted and ſpoyled as the

            <p>The Kings party give a reaſon for ſuch a difference had betwixt the Souldiers on either ſide, alleaging <hi>that the Countreys being Rebellious and Diſaffected, deny unto their Souldiers upon their march and in their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings a fit proviſion and ſupply for horſe and man, wherefore the Souldiers of His Majeſties party are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to rob and ſpoyl, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Anſwer to this Objection is had from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to what is here delivered, and the Reader to be ſatisfied in the Queſtion, what <hi>Rebellion, Treaſon</hi> truly is, what the ground and original of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys Diſaffection is?</p>
            <p>If His Majeſties Commiſſioners underſtand their charge againſt the Parliaments violating the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, becauſe of their aboliſhing old Laws; 'Tis anſwered, They have power to Abrogate and Repeal what they finde offenſive and exorbitant in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
            <p>The modern and poſitive Laws were by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed, and <hi>quicquid conſtituitur, eodem modo etiam diſſolvitur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No one Fundamental Law is by them diſſolved, or by their Acts yet violated, unleſſe the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Biſhops be held a Fundamental one; It was their Quarrel, and queſtionleſs their Exception, to be found both in their words, and by their or their Friends Writings, <hi>That the Parliament have tranſgreſſed the Ancient Laws, becauſe they have abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed Biſhops;</hi> they make the Law which conſtitutes
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:113760:72"/> them to be of equal time and value (belike) with that of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> when as moſt men know who have lookt into the Records, that many Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have bin held, many Acts paſſed <hi>Excluſo Clero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a cunning Argument and Artifice in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to incenſe the people againſt the Parliament, if it were they which give out the Parliament to have violated the Ancient Laws which the people were ready to defend, when as upon a through examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter complained of, there was no other Law violated but what concern'd the Biſhops partial in the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>To conclude the Queſtion touching the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Laws, which both ſides may ſeem to be guilty of; the matter is not whether the Ancient or New Laws be kept, whether thoſe long ſince made, or thoſe of a latter time be broken; a War lets all Laws looſe; but had the Law of not Diſſolving without the Parliaments conſent, been kept entirely and ſtrictly, the other Laws had not in the judgement of moſt men been broken.</p>
            <p>The Parliament may plead, Their undertakings and courſe of Juſtice cannot be made good, by reaſon of their power oppoſed, themſelves confronted.</p>
            <p>The great Law and Charter of the Subjects Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is enlarged into Statute Laws, all conducing to make up one <note n="*" place="margin">Suprema Lex ſalus Populi.</note> Supreme Law <hi>[The Subjects Safety.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The dividing of the Parliament Members, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to a Diſſolving of the Court contrary to a Law conſented unto by His Majeſty, hath added much to the ſhaking of the Ancient Laws; and this War occaſioned, as is before expreſſed, hath opened a way to the violating all other Laws.</p>
            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:113760:72"/>
            <p> The Contention hath ſince the firſt beginning thereof devolved to matter of Truſt (the third of the <hi>PROPOSITIONS</hi> in Demand) how the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery and Arms of the Kingdom ſhould be ſetled, and who to be truſted in the managing thereof; The King, rather thoſe about Him whom the Parliament ſuſpects, or the Parliament and thoſe whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute: So the <hi>Militia,</hi> the Fortreſſe and Author of the Subjects Safety, when well ſetled, bindes up, and as it were doth keep the <hi>Peace;</hi> it hath the turning power, and caſting voyce upon all emergent differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which may happen.</p>
            <p>The Kings Commiſſioners propoſe <hi>to have the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer thereof divided into an equal number of Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners on both ſides,</hi> which the Parliament Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners judge not reaſonable, for that they being named dividedly, will act dividedly on every Debate which happens according to their ſeveral Intereſts, and the Commiſſioners on either part will have partakers in the Quarrel; ſo the <hi>Militia</hi> thus ſetled, and to keep the <hi>Peace,</hi> may prove the overture of a renewed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if the Diſtribution thereof be aſſigned to fourty, whereof twenty to be named by the King, the other half by the Parliament; the King re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted to His former Dignity, can eaſily gain upon ſome one of thoſe which the Parliament ſhall make choice of; ſo the Kings part being the major, will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt the Vote and Judgement of the leſſer part: Thus, the Accompt caſt up, it would be all one for the King to name the whole number of thoſe for the <hi>Militia.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="140" facs="tcp:113760:73"/>
            <p> And whereas His Commiſſioners take it for granted <hi>That the Commiſsioners for the Parliament do admit the Jealouſies on either part to be mutual, therefore the</hi> Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia <hi>to be mutually and equally managed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Argument ſeems reaſonable, if true; for if the Cauſes of Jealouſie were mutual or equal in degree or time, the Reaſon for ſo dividing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were more important.</p>
            <p>But admit the Jealouſies to be mutual, Jealouſies may be as Injuries, mutual, yet diverſified in degree, as ſome more vehement, more certain then others, ſome of a longer, ſome of a ſhorter date.</p>
            <p>If it were as certain (as is before obſerved) that the Parliament did intend or attempt any thing againſt the King, as it is certain the Subjects Right and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty were incroached upon, no queſtion then but the fault reſts in the Parliament, and the whole War to be judged Defenſive on the Kings part.</p>
            <p>To the matter of Jealouſie; the Parliament ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the King <hi>to be carried away by evil Councel, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading Him and aſsiſting Him againſt His Supreme Councel of the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King and His party chargeth them with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rebels.</p>
            <p>The ſubſtance of which Charge is (as already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed) <hi>Their taking up Arms againſt Him, their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to deſtroy Him, wherefore as guilty of ſuch Treaſon to be oppoſed and fought againſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Argument is, as before examined, hoped and prayed for, from falſly ſuggeſted premiſes, unknown, ungranted.</p>
            <p>That whereof the Kings party is ſuſpected, there
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:113760:73"/> is pregnant preſumption for, yea, matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>So the Jealouſies ſeem to be preſented mutual, although differing in degree of certainty.</p>
            <p>Here then the oddes between the Accuſations on either ſide, the Kings and Parliaments; that whereof the Parliament ſtands Accuſed, is uncertain, unknown; that whereof the King's party is accuſed, there is vehement preſumption for.</p>
            <p>Now whether we ſhall weigh in the ſame Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the ſuppoſititious and unknown, with that which is certain and evident, and Jealouſies une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in themſelves whereon to paſſe a cenſure, let all men judge.</p>
            <p>The Kings Commiſſioners and His party ſeem in nothing more to get the ſtart of the Parliaments, then by their often ſpeaking and offering of terms of Peace, as of propoſing and accepting Treaties: But it is not who are the firſt and moſt frequent offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but who the moſt reaſonable and equal in the terms of Treating for a Peace.</p>
            <p>The ſetling a firm and well-grounded Peace by Treaty, ſhould be upon a ſureneſſe and equality of terms, which if it cannot be had, a compliance and condiſcending muſt, which is no loſſe of credit in the offending part.</p>
            <p>To retract an Error, argues two prime vertues, <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> and all offendors have not erred as of themſelves, or of their want of Judgement, but by the participation of anothers Error and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which they have prized too much.</p>
            <pb n="142" facs="tcp:113760:74"/>
            <p> What in the Narrative and Circumſtance of this War, is to be underſtood of the contrary thereto, Peace, and how to be obtained is to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>There is a Diverſity and Latitude in the word <hi>[Peace]</hi> If for one part utterly to ceaſe from Arms, and quietly to ſit down (which indeed were one ſtep to Peace) and to expect what then might befal on ſuch a ceaſing, were in the purſuit of Peace required; Or whether a Peace in its more proper definition of a <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Safe</hi> Accord, a reciprocal Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Tranquility eſtabliſhed in Truth and Equity, not <note n="*" place="margin">See the matter, means and definition of a Peace, and the contrary thereto, quoted out of ſeveral Authors by Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi> in his <hi>Eyrenarch,</hi> lib. 1. cap. 2. pag. 9.</note> Union of the mindes, that is not for the preſent to be had, but a reſtraining of the hands: So <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Safe</hi> are as it were the ſpecifical dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the definition of Peace: <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Plain</hi> might be added too, leaſt whileſt they ſpeak of <note place="margin">Que nihil habet in ſidiarum Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</note> Peace in their mouthes, they have War in their hearts.</p>
            <p>The latter <hi>[Safe]</hi> implyed by what peace it ſelf is ſometime taken in a great Lawyers ſence, calling the Kings Writs <hi>Brevia de pace,</hi> ſo that <hi>Safety</hi> being <note place="margin">

               <hi>and ſurely kept, that the Kings Subjects may ſafely go and come, and abide according to the Law of the Realm, and that Juſtice and Right be indifferently adminiſtred to every Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Texts of Scripture, <hi>Grace and Peace, Peace and Truth</hi> do go together, <hi>Peace and Righteouſneſſe</hi> like individual friends <hi>kiſſe each other:</hi> So ſafety, to perpetuate and ſtrengthen it, is requiſite to Peace, and a reſtraint might be had of the hands if an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mindes, and ſo on the other ſide, an Union of mindes, if a reſtraint of hands: The difficulty then reſts only how either or both, Unity of the one, or Reſtraint of the other may be had, whether by a meeting for a Treaty, or by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite of Victory by the ſword.</p>
            <p>A Treaty hath been had, Commiſſioners of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent quality met, and <hi>PROPOSITIONS</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-changeably ſent.</p>
            <p>What the carriage and event thereof hath been, the Author of the Relation of the paſſages there hath expreſſed, but whither impartially ſet down, the Commiſſioners are the onely witneſſes, whither his relation makes for or againſt his own party, the Reader is to judge.</p>
            <p>The Parliament whither in their propoſing or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of the Treaty, ſhewed their Inclination to a <hi>Peace,</hi> gaining nothing by the meeting (for no one <hi>PROPOSITION</hi> demanded was granted them) ſave only the credit of their ſincerity in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally meaning to acecompliſh that, for which the end of their meeting was.</p>
            <p>The ſeeking and enſuing <hi>Peace</hi> is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:113760:75"/> to be the fervor and end of their deſires; Neither they nor their friends ſhall gain by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the War; It is likewiſe to be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed on His Majeſties party, ſave ſome Officers and Commanders in chief in either Army; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners and Out-landiſh, who empty ours to fill their own purſes; And other Inſtruments appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the War, and imployed for raiſing money to defray the charge, may haply be thrivers by the War.</p>
            <p>But for the means of obtaining <hi>Peace,</hi> ſtanders by may be able to diſcern, wiſe to obſerve and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template on the means: Howbeit none are called, none ſent, none on whom the power and authority of managing the <hi>Peace</hi> is devolved, ſave the Court of Parliament alone, in whom we have entruſted all expedients to our Safety.</p>
            <p>If they ſhall judge the <hi>PROPOSITIONS</hi> formerly tendred to His Majecty, to be the onely and effectual means; The Subjects are to abide by their Judgement, which <hi>PROPOSITIONS</hi> may ſeem in number many, in their ſtrict quality extream and harſh; eſpecially in the Kings friends eye, as ſeeming to abate His accuſtomed Regal Dignity.</p>
            <p>Extreme diſeaſes require extreme remedies for their cure, and when Jealouſies are a long time breeding, the task will be as difficult in the means of diſpelling them: Evils when grown ſtrong, multiplied and cloſely wrought, need a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate inſtrument to lance and remove to ſtop the new ſpringing up of the ſame or the like.</p>
            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:113760:75"/>
            <p> The <hi>PROPOSITIONS</hi> are of two ſorts, the <note place="margin">The <hi>PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POSITI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS</hi> to be ſent ſuitable to the preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igent in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> the Preſervation of the Honor and juſt Power of a King diſpleaſed, the Parliament and people threatned are not of a tumultuary and eaſie diſpatch, not to be concluded in haſte, nor quarrelled with for the delay in ſending them, when as many interveening accidents may give occaſion for altering them: Nor can every looker on be a fit Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor or judge in this moſt weighty Cauſe and Controverſie touching the quality and fitneſſe of what is to be inſiſted on; the Parliaments moſt choice, elaborate and well weighed Councels are no more then needs to deliberate, compute, and a long time to be adviſing what is once and for ever to be eſtabliſhed, that His Majeſty may be no more a loſer, nor the welfare of His Subjects (which is the foundation of His happineſſe) endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the future: If the <hi>PROPOSITIONS</hi> be too high. His Majeſty may think the Parliament to be His King, and Himſelf may ſeem to ſtoop too low and beneath His Soveraignty to grant and ſign them; If they be of too low and ſhort aſſurance to ſecure the Subjects peace; The Parliaments forepaſt Acts and Councels are wholly fruſtrate, the labour of their endeavors loſt: And what is like to be the ſequel, any man may gueſſe.</note> one a calling Delinquents to accompt, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtice according to the degree of their offendings.</p>

            <p>The reaſon wherefore the Members in the Houſe of Parliament were preferred in their Countreys ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages to be their Judges, was for the opinion of their Wiſdom and Integrity above, at leaſt equal to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Countrey: Wiſdom conſiſts of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, Diffidence, foreſight; <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>For howbeit His Majeſty as a Chriſtian, as a King, may and cannot chuſe but have a deep ſence and compaſſionate heart againſt the farther ſhedding of his Subjects blood, His party which He profeſſeth under the name of friends not to deſert, will expect a large intereſt in His Power; their intereſt which when they have gained, any man may judge for what uſe it ſhall ſerve.</p>

            <p>The ſober, relenting and wiſe demeanors of theſe engaged, might have put a period to this War, if they ſteering their affections all one way to the light of Sence, Conſcience, Reaſon, ſhall ſet aſide the punctilio of reputation (which no wiſe man did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loſe) of being thought inconſtant; their actions will alike unite and joyn together againſt the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of Peace, as againſt a common Enemy, and every good Subject will according to the habiliments whereunto he has been uſed and bred, act and wiſh beſt only to that ſide which wiſheth beſt undivided<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unreſervedly to the King and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>In the dividing which, every one takes it ill to be ſuſpected to be partial, or that his wiſhes ſhould ſeem rather to incline to the King then to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the Parliament rather then to the King, they thinking that their wiſhing well to the King, is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:113760:78"/> to wiſh well to the King and Kingdom, becauſe the King proteſteth the welfare of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The peruſing this Treaty doth clear the queſtion, and doth ſettle and confine the doubtful Judgement of whoſoever may be miſtaken in this conflict.</p>
            <p>The Unity and joynt accord in the Houſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, may be a leading caſe to induce a general Unity among all the Subjects of the Kingdom: That as by the ſingular policy preſented in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony betwixt the Houſe of Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and as between the Commons themſelves ſtrengthening and crediting their proceedings, the like Unity may deſcend intirely to the inferior Members throughout the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>For howbeit there may be different wayes, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſputes by cauſe of various judgements, all tending to one and the ſelf ſame end, yet no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to divide them from their chief principle, <hi>The Subjects Peace;</hi> And although emulation alwayes attends great and eminent ſpirits, keeping off for the moſt part an accord of mindes, Gods Power is ſo much the more viſible in their actings and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavorings for Peace (Himſelf being <hi>the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Peace and lover of Concord, in making men to be of one minde in an Houſe.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Briefly, to compriſe the whole in a few words by way of queſtion, and for the ſooner reſtoring theſe unhappy Kingdoms to an happy Peace and general Unity, the matter of this Civil and unnatural War betwixt the Prince and people, betwixt the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of three Kingdoms contending each with other, as it had it's riſe from miſtakes and jealouſie,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:113760:79"/> doth now, as the poſſibility and enjoyment of a firm and laſting Peace, reſt and determine upon the clearing of theſe few queſtions; Whither His Majeſty has had evil Councellors &amp; Inſtruments about Him, who have diverted Him from the courſe of juſtice (ſome of whom ſtiled now His friends?)
